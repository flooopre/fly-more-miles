    excerpt: "Looking to buy Flying Blue miles in the UK? Here's everything you need to know about pricing, delivery, safety, and the best sources for topping up your balance in 2026.",
    content: `If you're based in the UK and you've discovered the value of Flying Blue miles—whether for Air France La Première, KLM business class, or those brilliant monthly Promo Rewards—you've probably wondered: where can I actually buy Flying Blue miles, and what's a fair price?

The short answer: yes, you can buy Flying Blue miles in the UK, and when you do it smartly, it's often far cheaper than paying cash for the same flights. But unlike British Airways Avios where you have multiple official purchase options, Flying Blue's buying landscape is a bit more fragmented. Some methods are excellent value; others will quietly rip you off.

In this guide, I'll walk you through every legitimate way to buy Flying Blue miles as a UK resident, what you should expect to pay, how to avoid scams, and when buying miles actually makes financial sense versus just booking a paid ticket.

![KLM Business Class 787 — one of the best uses of Flying Blue miles](https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/KLM-Business-Class-787-1.jpg)

## Can You Actually Buy Flying Blue Miles in the UK?

Yes—but there's no single "official" Flying Blue miles shop like BA's buy-Avios page. Instead, you have several options:

**1. Air France / KLM Direct Purchase**

Air France and KLM periodically run promotions where you can buy miles directly through their websites. These deals typically offer:
- 50% to 100% bonus miles (effectively halving the cost)
- Pricing in EUR (so GBP exchange rates matter)
- Purchase limits (usually 150,000 miles per account per year)

When there's a good bonus running, this is often the best value option. The problem? The promotions are unpredictable. You might see a 100% bonus in March, then nothing until September. If you need miles *right now* and there's no promo, you're paying full price—which isn't competitive.

**2. Credit Card Points Transfers**

This is hands-down the most flexible method for UK residents. Flying Blue is a transfer partner of all major transferable points currencies:

- **American Express Membership Rewards** (1:1, instant)
- **Chase Ultimate Rewards** (1:1, instant)
- **Citi ThankYou Points** (1:1, instant)
- **Capital One Miles** (1:1, instant)
- **Bilt Rewards** (1:1, instant—and Bilt runs frequent 50-100% transfer bonuses)

If you already hold an Amex Platinum, Chase Sapphire Reserve, or similar card, transferring points is usually the cheapest effective cost per mile. You're essentially "buying" miles at the rate you earned the credit card points—often under 1p per mile when you factor in sign-up bonuses and category bonuses.

The catch? You need to have accumulated the points first through card spend. This method doesn't work if you're short on miles today and haven't been earning credit card points.

**3. Third-Party Miles Brokers**

Services like MilesTopUp, points.com, and similar brokers sell Flying Blue miles by transferring them from credit card points on your behalf. You request a quote, pay via card or bank transfer, and receive miles in your Flying Blue account within 24-72 hours.

This method works when:
- You don't have transferable credit card points yourself
- There's no current Air France/KLM purchase promo
- You need miles quickly and can't wait for a promotion

The pricing is competitive with airline promos and significantly better than buying at full price direct. For UK buyers, this is often the fastest and most reliable way to top up exactly the number of miles you need without waiting for unpredictable promotions.

**4. Finnair Avios (Then Transfer)**

This is an obscure hack, but Finnair Plus uses the Avios currency family, and you can buy Avios through Finnair promotions (which run more frequently than Flying Blue promos), then transfer them to your Flying Blue account.

It's convoluted and involves linking multiple loyalty accounts, but when Finnair runs a strong 50% bonus, you can sometimes get miles cheaper this way than any other method. Only worth it if you're comfortable with the multi-step process.

## What Should Flying Blue Miles Cost in the UK?

Here's what to expect across different purchase methods:

| Method | Cost per Mile (GBP) | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| **Air France/KLM (no promo)** | ~2.0p | Expensive—avoid unless urgent |
| **Air France/KLM (50% bonus)** | ~1.3p | Good value when available |
| **Air France/KLM (100% bonus)** | ~1.0p | Excellent—buy maximum allowed |
| **Credit card transfer (effective cost)** | 0.5-1.2p | Depends on how you earned points |
| **Miles broker (MilesTopUp, etc.)** | 1.1-1.4p | Competitive, reliable, fast |
| **Finnair Avios transfer (promo)** | ~1.1p | Good if you can navigate process |

For context, if you're booking Air France business class Paris to New York and the award costs 60,000 miles, here's what you'd pay to buy those miles:

- **Full price (no bonus):** £1,200 → terrible value
- **50% bonus promo:** £780 → decent
- **100% bonus promo:** £600 → excellent
- **Miles broker:** £660-840 → reliable middle ground

Compare that to the cash business class fare (often £2,500-4,000), and buying miles at 1.0-1.4p each makes strong financial sense.

## Is It Safe to Buy Flying Blue Miles?

This is the biggest concern I hear from UK buyers: "Will my account get shut down?"

Here's the honest answer: **buying miles through legitimate channels is safe and within programme rules.** Air France and KLM explicitly allow you to purchase miles directly, and credit card points transfers are a core feature of the programme.

**What's safe:**
✅ Buying through Air France/KLM website directly  
✅ Transferring from Amex/Chase/Citi credit card points  
✅ Using established miles brokers with track records  

**What's risky:**
❌ Buying miles from individuals on forums/Facebook  
❌ Sharing your account login with third parties  
❌ "Too good to be true" deals from unknown sellers  

The key differentiator is *how* the miles get into your account. If they're purchased officially or transferred from legitimate credit card points, there's no risk. If someone's logging into your account and doing shady transfers, that's when problems happen.

**Red flags to avoid:**
- Anyone asking for your Flying Blue password
- Prices dramatically below 1p per mile (if it's too cheap, it's fraud)
- Sellers with no verifiable track record or company registration
- PayPal Friends & Family payment requests (no buyer protection)

Stick to established brokers with transparent processes, company details, and customer reviews. Paying slightly more for peace of mind is worth it.

## When Does Buying Flying Blue Miles Make Sense?

Not every redemption justifies buying miles. Here's when it's genuinely worth it:

**✅ Buy miles when:**

**1. Premium cabin redemptions with high cash fares**

Air France La Première or business class to long-haul destinations—where paid tickets cost £3,000-10,000 but awards cost 60,000-150,000 miles. Even buying miles at 1.3p each, you're saving thousands.

**2. Monthly Flying Blue Promo Rewards**

When your target route appears in the monthly promo list with 25-50% off, buying miles becomes even better value. Paris to Tokyo normally 70,000 miles? Now 52,500 with a 25% promo. Buying 52,500 miles at 1.2p = £630 for a business class seat that sells for £3,500.

**3. You're slightly short of an award**

You've found perfect availability, you have 45,000 miles, but you need 60,000. Buying the remaining 15,000 miles to complete the booking beats losing the award seat or paying cash for a £2,000+ ticket.

**❌ Don't buy miles when:**

**1. Economy redemptions**

Economy awards rarely offer enough value over cash fares to justify buying miles. You might pay £400 to buy 25,000 miles for an economy ticket you could book for £500 cash. Not worth it.

**2. Short-haul routes**

Europe to Europe, even in business class, usually doesn't deliver enough value. Better to just pay cash or use miles you've already earned.

**3. Dynamic pricing has inflated the award**

Flying Blue uses dynamic pricing, and sometimes they price awards absurdly high (100,000+ miles for routes that should cost 60,000). If the mileage cost looks inflated compared to typical pricing, don't buy miles—wait for better availability or use a different programme.

Here's the practical process:

### Option 1: Wait for Air France/KLM Promo (Best Value, Requires Patience)

1. Sign up for the Flying Blue newsletter
2. Follow FlyerTalk and frequent flyer blogs for promo alerts
3. When a 50% or 100% bonus is announced, log into flyingblue.com
4. Navigate to "Buy Miles" section
5. Purchase up to the maximum allowed (usually 150,000 miles)
6. Miles appear in your account instantly

5. Miles delivered within 24-72 hours

**Best for:** Immediate needs, no credit card points available, can't wait for promo

## Flying Blue vs Avios: Which Should UK Buyers Focus On?

If you're UK-based and trying to decide which loyalty currency to prioritize buying, here's my take:

**Buy Avios when:**
- You fly British Airways, Iberia, or Aer Lingus regularly
- You want predictable, distance-based award pricing
- You prefer short-haul European flights
- You value Qatar Airways QSuites

**Buy Flying Blue when:**
- You fly Air France or KLM regularly
- You're targeting premium cabins on SkyTeam airlines
- You're flexible with dates (to take advantage of Promo Rewards)
- You want access to Delta awards at reasonable prices

For most UK travellers, the honest answer is: accumulate both. Use Avios for BA and oneworld redemptions, use Flying Blue for Air France, KLM, and SkyTeam. They complement each other beautifully, and both transfer instantly from the same credit card points.

## Common Mistakes UK Buyers Make

**Mistake #1: Buying miles before confirming award availability**

Always search and confirm the exact award flight you want exists *before* buying miles. Award space can vanish in minutes—buy miles first and the seat might be gone by the time they arrive.

**Mistake #2: Ignoring the monthly Promo Rewards**

If your route appears in the monthly Promo Rewards list, wait until the first of the month, book the discounted award, *then* buy miles if you're short. You'll need 25-50% fewer miles.

**Mistake #3: Buying miles for low-value redemptions**

Not every award is worth buying miles for. Calculate the effective cost: if you're paying £600 in purchased miles for a flight that costs £700 cash, just pay cash and earn miles on the flight instead.

**Mistake #4: Buying from shady sellers to save £50**

The Flying Blue account closure risk from fraudulent miles isn't worth saving £50. Stick to legitimate sources even if they're slightly more expensive.

**Mistake #5: Forgetting exchange rates**

Air France prices miles in EUR. When the pound is strong against the euro, direct purchases become relatively cheaper. Check current exchange rates before deciding which method to use.

## The Bottom Line for UK Buyers

Flying Blue miles are absolutely worth buying—when you do it strategically. For premium cabin redemptions, monthly Promo Rewards, and topping up for award bookings, buying miles at 1.0-1.4p per mile delivers genuine value compared to paid fares.

The keys to success:
1. **Only buy for high-value redemptions** (business/first class, long-haul)
2. **Wait for 50-100% bonuses if you can** (best value)
3. **Use credit card transfers if you have points** (most flexible)
4. **Use established brokers for immediate needs** (reliable, safe)
5. **Never buy before confirming award availability** (critical!)

If you're short on Flying Blue miles for a booking and you've found the perfect award seat, buying miles is often the smartest financial decision. Just make sure the maths works—calculate what you're paying per mile, compare it to the cash fare, and proceed only when the value is obvious.

    title: "Best Price to Purchase Avios Points in 2026: Complete Pricing Guide",
    excerpt: "What's a fair price for Avios in 2026? From 0.92p to 2.45p per point, here's every purchasing option ranked by value—and when each one makes sense.",
    content: `If you're trying to figure out what Avios should cost when you buy them, you've probably noticed the same thing I did: the pricing is all over the place. British Airways sells them directly at 2.45p per point. Finnair runs promotions at under 1p per point. Credit card transfers could cost you anywhere from 0.5p to 1.5p depending on how you earned the points.

So what's a fair price? And more importantly, when does buying Avios actually make financial sense versus just paying cash for your flight?

In this guide, I'll break down every way to purchase Avios in 2026, what you should expect to pay, and the mathematical reality of when buying points delivers genuine value. No fluffy "it depends"—just honest pricing data and scenarios where buying makes sense.

![Qatar Airways QSuites — the kind of redemption that makes buying Avios worthwhile](https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Qatar-Airways-Qsuites-777-9.jpeg)

## What Are Avios Actually Worth?

Before we talk about purchasing prices, you need to understand what Avios are worth in redemptions. This gives you a baseline for determining when buying them makes sense.

**Typical redemption values:**
- **Poor redemption:** 0.3-0.5p per Avios (short-haul economy with high surcharges)
- **Decent redemption:** 1.0-1.5p per Avios (medium-haul business, sensible surcharges)
- **Excellent redemption:** 2.0-4.0p per Avios (long-haul business, partner airlines)
- **Outstanding redemption:** 5.0p+ per Avios (Qatar QSuites, JAL First, etc.)

The rule is simple: **never buy Avios for more than you'll get back in redemption value.** If you're planning a short-haul economy flight that delivers 0.5p per point, paying 1.3p per point to buy those Avios is financial madness. You'd be better off just booking a cash ticket.

But if you're booking Qatar QSuites where you're genuinely getting 5p+ per Avios, buying at 1.3p per point is a no-brainer. You're paying £1,300 in purchased Avios for a £5,000+ business class seat. That's a £3,700 saving.

## Every Way to Purchase Avios: Ranked by Price

Here's every legitimate method to buy Avios in 2026, ranked from cheapest to most expensive:

### 1. Avios Balance Boost — 0.92p per Avios (Conditionally Available)

**How it works:** British Airways allows you to purchase additional Avios equal to 100%, 200%, or 300% of the Avios you've earned in the previous 30 days, priced at just 0.92p per point. So if you earned 10,000 Avios last month from a flight or credit card, you can boost your balance by up to 30,000 additional Avios at £276.

**The catch:** This option only appears if you've had recent earning activity. If you haven't earned Avios in the last 30 days, Balance Boost simply won't be available. There's also an annual cap—after purchasing 300,000 Avios at this rate, the price jumps to 1.77p per point.

**Best for:** Frequent BA flyers or active credit card users who naturally earn Avios regularly and want to top up at the absolute cheapest rate.

### 2. Avios Subscription — 0.99p per Avios (Long-Term Planning)

**How it works:** British Airways offers a subscription model where you commit to purchasing 20,000 to 200,000 Avios per year, delivered monthly. If you opt for annual payment rather than monthly billing, you effectively get about two months free, bringing the cost down to roughly 0.99p per Avios.

**The catch:** Your Avios arrive gradually rather than as a lump sum. If you need 50,000 Avios next week to book an award, the subscription won't help. This is very much a long-game strategy for people who know they'll be redeeming regularly throughout the year.

**Best for:** Frequent travellers who consistently use Avios and prefer a set-and-forget accumulation strategy without thinking about it.

![KLM Business Class 787 — Avios can also book SkyTeam partners like KLM via partnerships](https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/KLM-Business-Class-787-1.jpg)

### 3. Credit Card Sign-Up Bonuses — Effective Cost Under 1p

**How it works:** UK credit cards like the British Airways American Express cards offer welcome bonuses of 25,000+ Avios when you meet minimum spend requirements. The Amex Preferred Rewards Gold earns Membership Rewards that transfer 1:1 to Avios with its own generous sign-up bonus.

When you calculate the annual fee against the bonus points, the effective cost per Avios often works out under 1p—sometimes as low as 0.5p if you were going to make the minimum spend anyway.

**The catch:** Requires a credit application, meeting minimum spend targets (typically £3,000-5,000 in three months), and paying annual fees ranging from £195 to £450. It's not instant—you need to spend, hit the threshold, then wait for the bonus to post.

**Best for:** UK residents with good credit who can comfortably meet minimum spend requirements and want to accumulate large balances over time.

### 4. Finnair Plus Promotions — 1.05p per Avios (When Available)

**How it works:** Finnair runs regular promotions where you can purchase Avios through their Finnair Plus programme. Since Finnair uses the Avios currency family, you can buy through Finnair and transfer to your BA Executive Club account by linking the two programmes.

During the best promotions—particularly 50% discount deals that appear several times a year—prices drop to around 1.05p per Avios.

**The catch:** Promotions are irregular and unpredictable. You can't count on them being available when you need them. You also need a Finnair Plus account, and the transfer process requires linking your accounts through the Avios system. It's not complicated, but it's an extra step.

**Best for:** Opportunistic buyers who monitor frequent flyer forums and are happy to jump on deals when they appear.

### 5. Transfer from American Express Membership Rewards — Variable (Depends How You Earned)

**How it works:** If you hold an Amex card that earns Membership Rewards (like the Platinum or Gold), you can transfer those points to British Airways at a 1:1 ratio. Transfers are instant.

The effective cost per Avios depends entirely on how you earned the Membership Rewards points:
- Earned through category bonuses (4x dining, 5x travel): ~0.5-0.75p per point
- Earned through standard spend (1x): ~1.0-1.2p per point
- Earned through sign-up bonuses: as low as 0.3-0.5p per point

**The catch:** You need to have already accumulated the Membership Rewards points through card spend. This doesn't help if you're short on Avios today and haven't been earning Amex points.

**Best for:** Amex cardholders who've built up a Membership Rewards balance and want instant, flexible access to Avios.

![Qatar Airways Business Class 777 — long-haul redemptions where buying Avios makes the most sense](https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Qatar-Airways-Business-Class-777-10.jpeg)

### 6. Iberia Plus Avios Purchase (During Promotions) — ~1.1p per Avios

**How it works:** Iberia, which also uses Avios as their currency, runs purchase promotions more frequently than British Airways. During these sales, you can buy Avios through Iberia at around 1.1p per point, then transfer them to your BA account for free (both use the same Avios currency).

**The catch:** Like Finnair, the promotions are irregular. You're also dealing with Iberia's website, which can be clunky, and transactions are processed in EUR, so exchange rates matter.

**Best for:** UK travellers comfortable navigating Iberia's platform and willing to wait for promotional periods.

### 7. Third-Party Miles Brokers — 1.2-1.4p per Avios (Reliable, Fast)

**How it works:** Services like MilesTopUp sell Avios by transferring them from credit card points on your behalf. You request a quote for the exact number of Avios you need, pay via card or bank transfer, and receive miles in your BA account within 24-72 hours.

Pricing typically ranges from 1.2p to 1.4p per Avios depending on the quantity and current availability.

**The catch:** You're paying a premium compared to the absolute cheapest methods like Balance Boost or credit card bonuses. But the trade-off is speed, reliability, and no requirement for recent earning activity or promotional timing.

**Best for:** People who need Avios quickly, don't have transferable credit card points, and can't wait for airline promotions to materialise.

### 8. Buy Directly from British Airways — 1.77p to 2.45p per Avios (Expensive)

**How it works:** The official ba.com purchase page lets you buy Avios directly with a credit card. Prices range from £49 for 2,000 Avios (2.45p each) down to £3,539 for 200,000 Avios (1.77p each at the bulk rate).

**The catch:** This is comfortably the most expensive option. Even the bulk rate of 1.77p per Avios is nearly double what you'd pay through Balance Boost or a decent promotion. You're paying for convenience and instant delivery—but you're paying a lot.

**Best for:** Genuinely only makes sense as a last resort when no other option is available and you need Avios immediately for a booking that won't wait.

## When Does Buying Avios Make Financial Sense?

Not every redemption justifies buying points. Here's the honest maths:

### ✅ Buy Avios when you're getting 3x+ value back

If you're buying at 1.3p per Avios, you need to be redeeming at 4p+ per Avios to make it genuinely worth it. That typically means:

**Premium cabins on long-haul routes:**
- Qatar QSuites (London to Sydney: 84,000 Avios vs £4,500 cash)
- JAL First Class (London to Tokyo: 60,000 Avios vs £6,000+ cash)
- Cathay Pacific Business (London to Hong Kong: 67,500 Avios vs £3,000 cash)

In these scenarios, buying 84,000 Avios at 1.3p per point costs £1,092. You're saving £3,408 versus the cash fare. That's a no-brainer.

### ✅ Buy when you're slightly short of an award

You've found perfect availability on the exact dates you want. You have 55,000 Avios but need 70,000. Buying the remaining 15,000 Avios at 1.3p per point (£195) to complete the booking is far better than losing the award seat or paying £3,000+ for a cash ticket.

### ❌ Don't buy for short-haul economy

Short-haul economy redemptions typically deliver 0.3-0.7p per Avios (especially after surcharges). If you're buying at 1.3p per Avios to redeem at 0.5p per Avios, you're losing money. Just pay cash for the £89 easyJet flight.

### ❌ Don't buy when BA fuel surcharges destroy the value

British Airways long-haul awards can have £400-700 in fuel surcharges even when using Avios. If you're paying £600 in surcharges PLUS buying 60,000 Avios at 1.3p (£780), that's £1,380 total—which might be close to or more than the cash fare. Check the total out-of-pocket cost before committing.

![Air France Lounge Paris CDG — premium cabin redemptions where buying Avios delivers real value](https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Air-France-Lounge-Paris-14.jpeg)

## Pricing Scenarios: Real Examples

Let me show you the maths on actual redemptions:

### Example 1: Qatar QSuites London → Singapore

- **Award cost:** 70,000 Avios + £120 in taxes
- **Cash business class fare:** £3,500
- **If buying Avios at 1.3p:** £910 + £120 = £1,030 total
- **Savings:** £2,470 (71% off)
- **Verdict:** Excellent value. Buy the Avios.

### Example 2: British Airways Club Suite London → New York

- **Award cost:** 50,000 Avios + £550 in surcharges
- **Cash business class fare:** £2,200
- **If buying Avios at 1.3p:** £650 + £550 = £1,200 total
- **Savings:** £1,000 (45% off)
- **Verdict:** Decent value, though surcharges hurt. Still worth it if dates/availability work.

### Example 3: Aer Lingus Economy Dublin → Boston

- **Award cost:** 13,000 Avios + £150 in taxes
- **Cash economy fare:** £250
- **If buying Avios at 1.3p:** £169 + £150 = £319 total
- **Verdict:** Terrible value. You'd pay MORE buying Avios than just booking cash. Don't do it.

The pattern is clear: **buying Avios makes sense for premium cabins and partner airlines with low surcharges.** It rarely makes sense for economy or BA long-haul (due to fuel surcharges).

## How to Actually Purchase Avios: Step-by-Step

**Method 1: BA Balance Boost (If Available)**
1. Log into ba.com and check your Executive Club account
2. Look for "Balance Boost" option in the Buy Avios section
3. If eligible, select your boost percentage (100%, 200%, or 300%)
4. Complete purchase—Avios arrive instantly

**Method 2: Credit Card Transfer (Amex, Chase, etc.)**
1. Log into your credit card account
2. Navigate to points transfer section
3. Select British Airways as transfer partner
4. Enter your Executive Club number
5. Initiate transfer (usually instant, sometimes 24-48 hours)

**Method 3: Wait for Finnair/Iberia Promotion**
1. Sign up for Finnair Plus and Iberia Plus newsletters
2. Monitor FlyerTalk and frequent flyer blogs for promo alerts
3. When a 50% bonus appears, buy through that programme
4. Link accounts and transfer Avios to BA

**Method 4: Use a Miles Broker**
1. Find the award flight you want and confirm availability
2. Request a quote from a reputable broker (e.g., MilesTopUp)
3. Provide your Executive Club number (never your password)
4. Pay via secure payment method
5. Receive Avios within 24-72 hours

## Common Mistakes People Make

**Mistake #1: Buying before confirming award availability**

Never buy Avios speculatively hoping a flight will be available. Search first, find the exact award, screenshot it, THEN buy miles. Award space vanishes quickly—you don't want to be stuck with purchased points and no redemption.

**Mistake #2: Ignoring fuel surcharges in the value calculation**

Some people see "70,000 Avios for London-Sydney business" and think it's a bargain, forgetting the £600+ in surcharges. Always calculate total out-of-pocket cost (bought Avios + surcharges + taxes) versus the cash fare before deciding.

**Mistake #3: Buying at full BA.com prices**

Paying 2.45p per Avios direct from ba.com is almost never justified. At a minimum, wait for a Finnair/Iberia promotion at 1.1p or use a broker at 1.3p. The price difference is massive.

**Mistake #4: Buying for low-value redemptions**

Just because you *can* redeem Avios for short-haul economy doesn't mean you should buy Avios for it. Calculate value-per-point. If you're getting back 0.5p per Avios and you paid 1.3p per Avios, you've lost money.

## The Bottom Line: What's a Fair Price in 2026?

Here's my take after years of buying and redeeming Avios:

**Excellent price:** Under 1p per Avios (Balance Boost, credit card bonuses, 100% promotions)  
**Good price:** 1.0-1.3p per Avios (Most promotions, reputable brokers)  
**Fair price:** 1.3-1.5p per Avios (If you need miles quickly)  
**Overpriced:** 1.5-1.8p per Avios (Only if truly desperate)  
**Rip-off:** Above 1.8p per Avios (Avoid unless absolute emergency)

If you're targeting premium cabin redemptions on partner airlines—Qatar, JAL, Cathay, Iberia—buying at up to 1.4p per Avios still delivers genuine value. You'll save thousands compared to cash fares.

But if you're buying for short-haul economy or BA long-haul with heavy surcharges, the maths rarely works. Just pay cash.
