## 3. Competitive Analysis

### 3.1 Competitor Landscape

| Competitor Type | Key Sites | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Direct Sellers** | points.com, avios.com, buyavios.com | Instant purchase, official bonuses (e.g., 100% Avios match) | High prices (2.5¢/mile), no educational content |
| **Content Blogs** | headforpoints.com, thepointsguy.co.uk, onemileatatime.com | Massive trust & traffic, deep content | No direct sales, indirect monetisation only |
| **Airlines** | britishairways.com, flyingblue.com | Official source, trust | Highest prices (2-3¢/mile) |

### 3.2 Competitor Keyword Strategies

**headforpoints.com** (UK Avios Authority)
- Targets: "buy avios with amex", "cheapest way to buy british airways avios", "avios promo rewards"
- Strategy: Timely deal alerts, transfer bonus guides, UK pricing focus (pence per point)
- Key content: "Cheapest Way to Buy Avios Points" — ranks #1 for multiple buy-intent keywords

**thepointsguy.co.uk** (Multi-Program UK)
- Targets: "best ways to earn flying blue miles", "avios vs flying blue redemption", "buy miles online uk"
- Strategy: Award charts, tax comparisons, credit card affiliate revenue

**onemileatatime.com** (Global Redemptions)

### 3.3 Content Gaps We Can Exploit

| Gap | Why It's Open | Our Opportunity |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|
| **Real-time price comparison tool** | No site aggregates live broker rates vs. airline prices | Build "Avios/Flying Blue Buy Simulator" |
| **Risk & best practice guides** | Minimal coverage of account flags, expiration rules, tax implications | "Ultimate Guide to Buying Avios Without Getting Burned" |
| **Avios vs Flying Blue head-to-heads** | Few route-specific comparisons with buy scenarios | "Avios vs Flying Blue for London-NYC: Which to Buy?" |
| **Bulk buyer / family guides** | Everyone targets individuals, not families pooling miles | "Top Up Avios for Family: How to Pool & Save" |
| **Video & promo alerts** | Static blog format dominates, no dynamic alerts | Weekly email: "Best Miles Deals This Week" |
| **B2B / corporate miles** | Completely ignored segment | "Corporate Miles Top-Up: Reward Your Team" |
