    title: "The Cheapest Way to Get Avios Points in 2026: Every Option Compared",
    excerpt: "From Balance Boost at under 1p per Avios to direct purchases at 2.45p — we break down every method to top up your Avios balance and what each one actually costs.",
    content: `If you need Avios for an award booking, the worst thing you can do is panic-buy at full price from ba.com. The difference between the cheapest and most expensive method is staggering — we're talking 0.92p versus 2.45p per Avios. That's nearly three times the cost for the same points.

Here's every method available in 2026, ranked from cheapest to most expensive, with honest pros and cons for each.

## 1. Avios Balance Boost — From 0.92p per Avios

This is the cheapest standard option for most people. Balance Boost lets you purchase a lump sum of Avios equal to 100%, 200%, or 300% of the Avios you've earned in the last 30 days.

If you earned 10,000 Avios from a flight or credit card spend last month, you can boost your balance by up to 30,000 additional Avios at 0.92p each. That's £276 for 30,000 Avios — hard to beat.

**The catch:** You need recent earning activity. If you haven't earned Avios in the last 30 days, this option won't appear. There's also a 300,000 Avios annual cap, after which the price jumps to 1.77p.

**Best for:** Topping up after a credit card bonus or flight. Plan your earning activity ahead of a big booking.

## 2. Avios Subscription — From 0.99p per Avios

A newer option that works like a monthly direct debit. You commit to a plan and receive Avios in monthly instalments. Four tiers are available, from 20,000 to 200,000 Avios per year.

Annual payment gets you roughly two months free compared to monthly billing, bringing the effective cost down to about 0.99p per Avios on the larger plans.

**The catch:** Avios arrive monthly, not as a lump sum. If you need 50,000 Avios next week for a booking, this won't help. It's a long game.

**Best for:** People who know they'll redeem regularly and want to build a balance over time.

## 3. Credit Card Sign-Up Bonuses — Effective Cost Under 1p

The BA American Express cards offer 25,000+ Avios as welcome bonuses. The Amex Preferred Rewards Gold earns Membership Rewards points that transfer 1:1 to Avios, with a 20,000-point sign-up bonus.

If you factor in the annual fee against the bonus, the effective cost per Avios often works out under 1p — sometimes as low as 0.5p if you'd be spending the money anyway.

**The catch:** Requires a credit application, minimum spend targets (typically £3,000–5,000 in three months), and annual fees (£195–450). Not instant gratification.

**Best for:** UK residents who can meet minimum spends. The single best long-term strategy for accumulating Avios.

## 4. Finnair Plus Promotions — From ~1.05p per Avios

Finnair runs regular promotions where you can purchase Avios through their Privilege Club. Since Finnair uses Avios as their currency, these points can be transferred to your British Airways account by linking the two programmes.

During the best promotions (like the 50% discount deals), prices drop to around 1.05p per Avios — exceptional value for a direct purchase.

**The catch:** Promotions are irregular. You need a Finnair Plus account, and transferring to BA requires linking accounts through the Avios system. Not complicated, but an extra step.

**Best for:** Opportunistic buyers who check regularly and jump on deals.

## 5. Qatar Airways Privilege Club — From ~1.75p per Avios

Qatar Airways also uses Avios and runs periodic purchase promotions. Standard pricing starts around 1.75p, but bonus offers can bring this down significantly.

**The catch:** Promotions are less frequent than Finnair. Prices are usually in USD, so exchange rates matter for UK buyers.

**Best for:** When Qatar runs a strong promotion and other options aren't available.

## 6. Buy Directly from BA — 1.77p to 2.45p per Avios

The official ba.com purchase page is the most straightforward option but also the most expensive. Prices range from £49 for 2,000 Avios (2.45p each) down to £3,539 for 200,000 Avios (1.77p each).

**The catch:** Even the bulk rate of 1.77p is nearly double what you'd pay through Balance Boost. Only makes sense if no other option is available and you need Avios immediately.

**Best for:** Emergencies only. Check every other option first.

## 7. Use a Top-Up Service — Competitive Rates, Fast Delivery

Services like MilesTopUp transfer Avios directly to your account using credit card points transfer mechanisms. You request a quote, pay, and miles arrive within 24–48 hours.

The advantage is consistency: you get competitive rates without waiting for airline promotions, and there's no need for recent earning activity (unlike Balance Boost). It's particularly useful for larger top-ups where the convenience factor matters.

**Best for:** When you need a specific amount of Avios quickly, at a predictable price, without jumping through hoops.

## Which Method Should You Choose?

It depends on your timeline and situation:

**If you have time (months):** Credit card bonuses + Balance Boost is the unbeatable combo. Earn Avios through spending, then boost at 0.92p.

**If you need Avios within weeks:** Check Finnair and Qatar for active promotions. If none are running, a top-up service gives you a reliable price.

**If you need Avios right now:** A top-up service (24–48 hours) or direct BA purchase (instant) are your options. The price difference between them can be significant, so always get a quote first.

**The golden rule:** Never buy Avios speculatively. Only top up when you have a specific booking in mind and know exactly how many points you need. Check the Avios plus cash combinations on ba.com too — sometimes paying a bit more cash and fewer Avios is the smarter play.`,

    title: "How to Get Flying Blue Miles in 2026: The Complete Guide",
    excerpt: "Everything you need to know about earning, buying, and maximising Flying Blue miles — from monthly Promo Rewards to transfer partners and sweet spot redemptions.",
    content: `Flying Blue is the loyalty programme of Air France and KLM, and it's arguably the best programme in Europe for award travel. Intra-European flights start at just 4,000 miles one-way, and the monthly Promo Rewards can slash prices by 25–50%.

But here's the thing: most people don't have enough miles when they find the perfect award seat. This guide covers every way to build your Flying Blue balance — fast.

## What Makes Flying Blue Special

Before we get into earning methods, here's why Flying Blue is worth focusing on:

**Lowest intra-Europe awards:** 4,000–8,000 miles for a one-way economy flight within Europe. Try finding that in any other programme.

**Monthly Promo Rewards:** Every month, Air France and KLM release discounted award flights with 25–50% off the standard mileage cost. A business class flight from Amsterdam to New York that normally costs 70,000 miles might drop to 50,000 during a promo.

**SkyTeam access:** Your miles work on Air France, KLM, Delta, Korean Air, Vietnam Airlines, and more. That's global coverage.

**No expiration with activity:** As long as you earn or spend at least one mile every 24 months, your balance stays alive.

## Method 1: Transfer from Credit Card Programmes

The fastest way to build a large Flying Blue balance is through credit card points transfers. All major flexible points programmes transfer to Flying Blue at favourable ratios.

**1:1 Transfer Partners:**
- American Express Membership Rewards
- Chase Ultimate Rewards
- Citi ThankYou Rewards
- Capital One Miles
- Bilt Rewards

**Other Partners:**
- Marriott Bonvoy: 3:1 ratio (60,000 Bonvoy = 20,000 Flying Blue, plus a 5,000-mile bonus for transfers of 60,000+)

Transfers from Amex, Chase, and Citi are typically instant. This means you can search for an award flight, confirm availability, transfer the miles, and book — all within minutes.

**Pro tip:** Watch for transfer bonuses. Amex and Chase occasionally run 20–30% bonus promotions on transfers to Flying Blue. When these hit, it's time to move points.

## Method 2: Fly with SkyTeam Airlines

Every flight on Air France, KLM, or a SkyTeam partner earns Flying Blue miles based on your ticket price (not distance).

Base earning rates per euro spent on the ticket:
- Explorer (no status): 4 miles per euro
- Silver: 6 miles per euro
- Gold: 7 miles per euro
- Platinum: 8 miles per euro

A €500 round trip Paris–New York in economy earns 2,000 miles at the base level. Not huge, but it adds up — especially if you're a regular flyer on these routes.

## Method 3: Monthly Promo Rewards

This is Flying Blue's killer feature. Around the first week of every month, Air France and KLM publish discounted award flights for that month.

**How they work:**
- Log in to your Flying Blue account
- Search award flights with the Promo Rewards filter
- Discounts range from 25% to 50% off standard prices
- Available in all cabins: economy, premium economy, business
- Must be booked by month-end
- Limited availability — book fast

**Recent examples:**
- February 2026: 25% off Europe to US routes (NYC, Boston to Amsterdam/Paris)
- Typical: 15,000 miles for intra-Europe business class (normally 20,000–30,000)

**Pro tip:** Set a calendar reminder for the 5th of every month. Check the promo page immediately. The best availability goes within days.

## Method 4: Hotel and Partner Earning

Flying Blue partners with hotels, car rentals, and shopping portals:

**Hotels:**
- Booking.com: 2 miles per euro spent, plus periodic 15–30% bonus promotions
- Hyatt partnership: 500 miles per qualifying stay

**Car Rentals:**
- Hertz: Up to 12 miles per euro on electric vehicles

**Shopping:**
- Air France/KLM shopping portals offer bonus miles at hundreds of retailers

These aren't going to fill your account quickly, but they're free miles on spending you'd do anyway.

## Method 5: Buy Miles or Use a Top-Up Service

Sometimes you find the perfect award seat but you're 10,000 or 20,000 miles short. Waiting to earn them through flying or credit cards means losing that seat.

**Buying direct from Air France/KLM:** Available but pricing varies. Typically 1.5–3 cents per mile depending on quantity and promotions. Check the Flying Blue website for current rates.

**Using a top-up service:** Services like MilesTopUp can add Flying Blue miles to your account within 24–48 hours at competitive rates. You get a personalised quote based on the quantity you need.

**When this makes sense:** Only when you have a specific booking in mind. Calculate the cost of the miles versus paying cash for the ticket. If you're getting more than 1.5 cents of value per mile on the redemption, topping up is a good deal.

## Method 6: Family Pooling

Flying Blue allows up to 8 accounts to pool miles together. This is a game-changer for families — combine everyone's earning into one pot and book faster.

Setting it up is free through the Flying Blue website. Each member still earns into their own account, but you can access the combined balance for bookings.

## Best Redemption Sweet Spots

Knowing where your miles go furthest helps you decide how many to accumulate:

**Intra-Europe:** 4,000–8,000 miles one-way in economy. Amsterdam to Rome, Paris to Barcelona — these are incredible values.

**Europe to North America:** 25,000–35,000 miles one-way in economy during Promo Rewards. Business class from 50,000 miles.

**Europe to Asia/Middle East:** 30,000–50,000 miles one-way in economy. Paris to Dubai, Amsterdam to Tokyo.

**Business class to the US:** The sweet spot. A lie-flat seat from Paris or Amsterdam to New York for 50,000–70,000 miles (35,000–50,000 during promos) is outstanding value when the cash fare is often €2,000+.

## Flying Blue vs Other Programmes for Europe

How does Flying Blue stack up for European travel?

**Flying Blue:** 4,000–8,000 miles intra-Europe. Monthly promos. SkyTeam network.

**British Airways (Avios):** Starts around 6,000 Avios for short-haul, but fuel surcharges on BA flights are brutal. Avios are better for Oneworld partners like Qatar Airways.

**Virgin Atlantic:** 10,000 miles minimum for intra-Europe. Less competitive on short-haul.

**Verdict:** For intra-Europe and Air France/KLM routes, Flying Blue wins. For long-haul premium cabins on Qatar or Cathay Pacific, Avios might be better. Ideally, you want both.

## The Strategy

Here's the playbook for building a useful Flying Blue balance:

1. **Get a flexible points credit card** (Amex, Chase) and earn on everyday spending
2. **Watch for transfer bonuses** — move points to Flying Blue during 20–30% promotions
3. **Check Promo Rewards monthly** — set a calendar reminder
4. **Use family pooling** if you have a partner or family who also fly
5. **Top up when needed** — don't lose a great award seat because you're 10k miles short
6. **Stack earning:** shopping portals + hotels + flights + credit cards

The goal isn't to hoard miles forever. It's to have enough when that perfect award seat appears — and to book it before someone else does.`,

    excerpt: "Understanding the key differences between topping up your miles through a service and getting them directly from the airline.",
    content: `When you need extra miles for a redemption, you generally have two options: buy them directly from the airline, or use a miles top-up service. Here's how they compare.\n\n## Buying Miles from Airlines\n\nBoth British Airways and Air France/KLM allow you to purchase miles directly. However, the cost per mile is often significantly higher than market rates. Airlines typically charge 2–3 cents per mile, making large purchases expensive.\n\n## Using a Miles Top-Up Service\n\nServices like MilesTopUp offer miles at competitive rates, often 30–50% cheaper than buying directly. The process is simple: you tell us how many miles you need, we provide a quote, and the miles are added to your account.\n\n## Key Differences\n\n**Price:** Top-up services consistently offer better rates than airlines.\n\n**Speed:** Both options are relatively quick, but top-up services often deliver within 24–72 hours.\n\n**Flexibility:** Airlines may have minimum purchase requirements. Top-up services are more flexible with quantities.\n\n**Legitimacy:** Reputable top-up services operate within the terms of loyalty programs. Always choose a trusted provider.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nIf you're looking for the best value, a miles top-up service is almost always the smarter choice. Check MilesTopUp for a free quote today.`,
