    title: "How to Earn Avios Fast: 7 Proven Strategies for 2026",
    excerpt: "Discover the most effective ways to accumulate Avios points quickly, from credit card bonuses to strategic shopping portals.",
    content: `Avios are one of the most versatile loyalty currencies in the world. Whether you're saving for a short-haul escape or a long-haul adventure in business class, building your Avios balance is key.\n\n## 1. Sign-Up Bonuses from Credit Cards\n\nThe fastest way to earn a large chunk of Avios is through credit card welcome bonuses. Many co-branded British Airways cards offer 50,000–100,000 Avios after meeting a minimum spend requirement.\n\n## 2. Use Shopping Portals\n\nThe British Airways shopping portal lets you earn bonus Avios on everyday purchases at hundreds of retailers. Always check the portal before shopping online.\n\n## 3. Dining Programs\n\nRegister your credit or debit cards with dining reward programs linked to Avios. You'll earn extra points simply by eating at participating restaurants.\n\n## 4. Transfer from Bank Points\n\nIf you collect points with programs like Amex Membership Rewards or Chase Ultimate Rewards, you can transfer them to Avios at favourable ratios.\n\n## 5. Fly with Oneworld Partners\n\nEvery flight on British Airways or a Oneworld alliance partner earns Avios. Book codeshare flights strategically to maximise your earning rate.\n\n## 6. Hotel Transfers\n\nMarriott Bonvoy points can be converted to Avios with a bonus when transferring in blocks of 60,000.\n\n## 7. Top Up Your Balance\n\nWhen you're just a few thousand Avios short of a redemption, topping up your balance is the smartest move. Services like MilesTopUp help you bridge the gap quickly and affordably.`,

    content: `Flying Blue, the loyalty program of Air France and KLM, offers some of the best value redemptions in Europe — if you know where to look.\n\n## Promo Rewards\n\nEvery month, Flying Blue releases discounted award flights called Promo Rewards.

Some partner routes offer exceptional value that you won't find on Air France or KLM metal.\n\n## Top Up for That Dream Flight\n\nOften you'll find the perfect award seat but be a few thousand miles short.

    title: "Miles Top-Up vs. Buying Miles Directly: What's the Difference?",
    excerpt: "Understanding the key differences between topping up your miles through a broker and purchasing directly from the airline.",
    content: `When you need extra miles for a redemption, you generally have two options: buy them directly from the airline, or use a miles top-up service. Here's how they compare.\n\n## Buying Miles from Airlines\n\nBoth British Airways and Air France/KLM allow you to purchase miles directly. However, the cost per mile is often significantly higher than market rates. Airlines typically charge 2–3 cents per mile, making large purchases expensive.\n\n## Using a Miles Top-Up Service\n\nServices like MilesTopUp offer miles at competitive rates, often 30–50% cheaper than buying directly. The process is simple: you tell us how many miles you need, we provide a quote, and the miles are added to your account.\n\n## Key Differences\n\n**Price:** Top-up services consistently offer better rates than airlines.\n\n**Speed:** Both options are relatively quick, but top-up services often deliver within 24–72 hours.\n\n**Flexibility:** Airlines may have minimum purchase requirements. Top-up services are more flexible with quantities.\n\n**Legitimacy:** Reputable top-up services operate within the terms of loyalty programs. Always choose a trusted provider.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nIf you're looking for the best value, a miles top-up service is almost always the smarter choice. Check MilesTopUp for a free quote today.`,
