    title: "The Cheapest Way to Get Avios Points in 2026: Every Option Compared",
    excerpt: "From Balance Boost at under 1p per Avios to direct purchases at 2.45p — we break down every method to top up your Avios balance and what each one actually costs.",
    content: `If you need Avios for an award booking, the worst thing you can do is panic-buy at full price from ba.com. The difference between the cheapest and most expensive method is staggering — we're talking 0.92p versus 2.45p per Avios. That's nearly three times the cost for the same points.

Here's every method available in 2026, ranked from cheapest to most expensive, with honest pros and cons for each.

## 1. Avios Balance Boost — From 0.92p per Avios

![British Airways — the home of Avios points](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584084807193-bed442df7a75?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

This is the cheapest standard option for most people. Balance Boost lets you purchase a lump sum of Avios equal to 100%, 200%, or 300% of the Avios you've earned in the last 30 days.

If you earned 10,000 Avios from a flight or credit card spend last month, you can boost your balance by up to 30,000 additional Avios at 0.92p each. That's £276 for 30,000 Avios — hard to beat.

**The catch:** You need recent earning activity. If you haven't earned Avios in the last 30 days, this option won't appear. There's also a 300,000 Avios annual cap, after which the price jumps to 1.77p.

**Best for:** Topping up after a credit card bonus or flight. Plan your earning activity ahead of a big booking.

## 2. Avios Subscription — From 0.99p per Avios

A newer option that works like a monthly direct debit. You commit to a plan and receive Avios in monthly instalments. Four tiers are available, from 20,000 to 200,000 Avios per year.

Annual payment gets you roughly two months free compared to monthly billing, bringing the effective cost down to about 0.99p per Avios on the larger plans.

**The catch:** Avios arrive monthly, not as a lump sum. If you need 50,000 Avios next week for a booking, this won't help. It's a long game.

**Best for:** People who know they'll redeem regularly and want to build a balance over time.

## 3. Credit Card Sign-Up Bonuses — Effective Cost Under 1p

![Credit card rewards are the fastest way to earn Avios](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556742049-0cfed4f6a45d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

The BA American Express cards offer 25,000+ Avios as welcome bonuses. The Amex Preferred Rewards Gold earns Membership Rewards points that transfer 1:1 to Avios, with a 20,000-point sign-up bonus.

If you factor in the annual fee against the bonus, the effective cost per Avios often works out under 1p — sometimes as low as 0.5p if you'd be spending the money anyway.

**The catch:** Requires a credit application, minimum spend targets (typically £3,000–5,000 in three months), and annual fees (£195–450). Not instant gratification.

**Best for:** UK residents who can meet minimum spends. The single best long-term strategy for accumulating Avios.

## 4. Finnair Plus Promotions — From ~1.05p per Avios

Finnair runs regular promotions where you can purchase Avios through their Privilege Club. Since Finnair uses Avios as their currency, these points can be transferred to your British Airways account by linking the two programmes.

During the best promotions (like the 50% discount deals), prices drop to around 1.05p per Avios — exceptional value for a direct purchase.

**The catch:** Promotions are irregular. You need a Finnair Plus account, and transferring to BA requires linking accounts through the Avios system. Not complicated, but an extra step.

**Best for:** Opportunistic buyers who check regularly and jump on deals.

## 5. Qatar Airways Privilege Club — From ~1.75p per Avios

![Qatar Airways Q Suites — bookable with Avios](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684929167916-a844fcf314d7?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

Qatar Airways also uses Avios and runs periodic purchase promotions. Standard pricing starts around 1.75p, but bonus offers can bring this down significantly.

**The catch:** Promotions are less frequent than Finnair. Prices are usually in USD, so exchange rates matter for UK buyers.

**Best for:** When Qatar runs a strong promotion and other options aren't available.

## 6. Buy Directly from BA — 1.77p to 2.45p per Avios

The official ba.com purchase page is the most straightforward option but also the most expensive. Prices range from £49 for 2,000 Avios (2.45p each) down to £3,539 for 200,000 Avios (1.77p each).

**The catch:** Even the bulk rate of 1.77p is nearly double what you'd pay through Balance Boost. Only makes sense if no other option is available and you need Avios immediately.

**Best for:** Emergencies only. Check every other option first.

## 7. Use a Top-Up Service — Competitive Rates, Fast Delivery

Services like MilesTopUp transfer Avios directly to your account using credit card points transfer mechanisms. You request a quote, pay, and miles arrive within 24–48 hours.

The advantage is consistency: you get competitive rates without waiting for airline promotions, and there's no need for recent earning activity (unlike Balance Boost). It's particularly useful for larger top-ups where the convenience factor matters.

**Best for:** When you need a specific amount of Avios quickly, at a predictable price, without jumping through hoops.

## Which Method Should You Choose?

![Choosing the right method depends on your timeline](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1699810917663-2341cd65afee?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

It depends on your timeline and situation:

**If you have time (months):** Credit card bonuses + Balance Boost is the unbeatable combo. Earn Avios through spending, then boost at 0.92p.

**If you need Avios within weeks:** Check Finnair and Qatar for active promotions. If none are running, a top-up service gives you a reliable price.

**If you need Avios right now:** A top-up service (24–48 hours) or direct BA purchase (instant) are your options. The price difference between them can be significant, so always get a quote first.

**The golden rule:** Never buy Avios speculatively. Only top up when you have a specific booking in mind and know exactly how many points you need. Check the Avios plus cash combinations on ba.com too — sometimes paying a bit more cash and fewer Avios is the smarter play.`,

    title: "How to Get Flying Blue Miles in 2026: The Complete Guide",
    excerpt: "Everything you need to know about earning, buying, and maximising Flying Blue miles — from monthly Promo Rewards to transfer partners and sweet spot redemptions.",
    content: `Flying Blue is the loyalty programme of Air France and KLM, and it's arguably the best programme in Europe for award travel. Intra-European flights start at just 4,000 miles one-way, and the monthly Promo Rewards can slash prices by 25–50%.

But here's the thing: most people don't have enough miles when they find the perfect award seat. This guide covers every way to build your Flying Blue balance — fast.

## What Makes Flying Blue Special

![KLM — one of the two airlines behind Flying Blue](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1742429577899-369b2c19230d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

Before we get into earning methods, here's why Flying Blue is worth focusing on:

**Lowest intra-Europe awards:** 4,000–8,000 miles for a one-way economy flight within Europe. Try finding that in any other programme.

**Monthly Promo Rewards:** Every month, Air France and KLM release discounted award flights with 25–50% off the standard mileage cost. A business class flight from Amsterdam to New York that normally costs 70,000 miles might drop to 50,000 during a promo.

**SkyTeam access:** Your miles work on Air France, KLM, Delta, Korean Air, Vietnam Airlines, and more. That's global coverage.

**No expiration with activity:** As long as you earn or spend at least one mile every 24 months, your balance stays alive.

## Method 1: Transfer from Credit Card Programmes

![Transfer credit card points to Flying Blue for instant miles](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1646992914433-de93d0d06c98?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

The fastest way to build a large Flying Blue balance is through credit card points transfers. All major flexible points programmes transfer to Flying Blue at favourable ratios.

**1:1 Transfer Partners:**
- American Express Membership Rewards
- Chase Ultimate Rewards
- Citi ThankYou Rewards
- Capital One Miles
- Bilt Rewards

**Other Partners:**
- Marriott Bonvoy: 3:1 ratio (60,000 Bonvoy = 20,000 Flying Blue, plus a 5,000-mile bonus for transfers of 60,000+)

Transfers from Amex, Chase, and Citi are typically instant. This means you can search for an award flight, confirm availability, transfer the miles, and book — all within minutes.

**Pro tip:** Watch for transfer bonuses. Amex and Chase occasionally run 20–30% bonus promotions on transfers to Flying Blue. When these hit, it's time to move points.

## Method 2: Fly with SkyTeam Airlines

Every flight on Air France, KLM, or a SkyTeam partner earns Flying Blue miles based on your ticket price (not distance).

Base earning rates per euro spent on the ticket:
- Explorer (no status): 4 miles per euro
- Silver: 6 miles per euro
- Gold: 7 miles per euro
- Platinum: 8 miles per euro

A €500 round trip Paris–New York in economy earns 2,000 miles at the base level. Not huge, but it adds up — especially if you're a regular flyer on these routes.

## Method 3: Monthly Promo Rewards

![Air France business class — bookable at a discount during Promo Rewards](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1719405524195-c3a331daa84f?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

This is Flying Blue's killer feature. Around the first week of every month, Air France and KLM publish discounted award flights for that month.

**How they work:**
- Log in to your Flying Blue account
- Search award flights with the Promo Rewards filter
- Discounts range from 25% to 50% off standard prices
- Available in all cabins: economy, premium economy, business
- Must be booked by month-end
- Limited availability — book fast

**Recent examples:**
- February 2026: 25% off Europe to US routes (NYC, Boston to Amsterdam/Paris)
- Typical: 15,000 miles for intra-Europe business class (normally 20,000–30,000)

**Pro tip:** Set a calendar reminder for the 5th of every month. Check the promo page immediately. The best availability goes within days.

## Method 4: Hotel and Partner Earning

Flying Blue partners with hotels, car rentals, and shopping portals:

**Hotels:**
- Booking.com: 2 miles per euro spent, plus periodic 15–30% bonus promotions
- Hyatt partnership: 500 miles per qualifying stay

**Car Rentals:**
- Hertz: Up to 12 miles per euro on electric vehicles

**Shopping:**
- Air France/KLM shopping portals offer bonus miles at hundreds of retailers

These aren't going to fill your account quickly, but they're free miles on spending you'd do anyway.

## Method 5: Buy Miles or Use a Top-Up Service

Sometimes you find the perfect award seat but you're 10,000 or 20,000 miles short. Waiting to earn them through flying or credit cards means losing that seat.

**Buying direct from Air France/KLM:** Available but pricing varies. Typically 1.5–3 cents per mile depending on quantity and promotions. Check the Flying Blue website for current rates.

**Using a top-up service:** Services like MilesTopUp can add Flying Blue miles to your account within 24–48 hours at competitive rates. You get a personalised quote based on the quantity you need.

**When this makes sense:** Only when you have a specific booking in mind. Calculate the cost of the miles versus paying cash for the ticket. If you're getting more than 1.5 cents of value per mile on the redemption, topping up is a good deal.

## Method 6: Family Pooling

Flying Blue allows up to 8 accounts to pool miles together. This is a game-changer for families — combine everyone's earning into one pot and book faster.

Setting it up is free through the Flying Blue website. Each member still earns into their own account, but you can access the combined balance for bookings.

## Best Redemption Sweet Spots

![Flying Blue sweet spots include Paris and Amsterdam routes](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1679231926690-cb1e8abfcefd?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

Knowing where your miles go furthest helps you decide how many to accumulate:

**Intra-Europe:** 4,000–8,000 miles one-way in economy. Amsterdam to Rome, Paris to Barcelona — these are incredible values.

**Europe to North America:** 25,000–35,000 miles one-way in economy during Promo Rewards. Business class from 50,000 miles.

**Europe to Asia/Middle East:** 30,000–50,000 miles one-way in economy. Paris to Dubai, Amsterdam to Tokyo.

**Business class to the US:** The sweet spot. A lie-flat seat from Paris or Amsterdam to New York for 50,000–70,000 miles (35,000–50,000 during promos) is outstanding value when the cash fare is often €2,000+.

## Flying Blue vs Other Programmes for Europe

How does Flying Blue stack up for European travel?

**Flying Blue:** 4,000–8,000 miles intra-Europe. Monthly promos. SkyTeam network.

**British Airways (Avios):** Starts around 6,000 Avios for short-haul, but fuel surcharges on BA flights are brutal. Avios are better for Oneworld partners like Qatar Airways.

**Virgin Atlantic:** 10,000 miles minimum for intra-Europe. Less competitive on short-haul.

**Verdict:** For intra-Europe and Air France/KLM routes, Flying Blue wins. For long-haul premium cabins on Qatar or Cathay Pacific, Avios might be better. Ideally, you want both.

## The Strategy

Here's the playbook for building a useful Flying Blue balance:

1. **Get a flexible points credit card** (Amex, Chase) and earn on everyday spending
2. **Watch for transfer bonuses** — move points to Flying Blue during 20–30% promotions
3. **Check Promo Rewards monthly** — set a calendar reminder
4. **Use family pooling** if you have a partner or family who also fly
5. **Top up when needed** — don't lose a great award seat because you're 10k miles short
6. **Stack earning:** shopping portals + hotels + flights + credit cards

The goal isn't to hoard miles forever. It's to have enough when that perfect award seat appears — and to book it before someone else does.`,

    title: "What Are Avios? The Complete Beginner's Guide for 2026",
    excerpt: "Avios are the loyalty currency used by British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, Qatar Airways and more. Here's everything you need to know — what they're worth, how to earn them, and how to use them.",
    content: `You've probably heard people talk about Avios. Maybe a colleague casually mentioned flying business class to New York "basically for free," or you spotted the word on your British Airways booking confirmation and wondered what it actually meant. Perhaps you've got a few thousand sitting in an Executive Club account somewhere and never really thought about what to do with them.

Whatever brought you here, this guide is going to walk you through everything — what Avios are, why they matter, how the whole system works, and most importantly, how to make the most of them. I'll try to keep things practical and honest rather than drowning you in jargon.

## The Basics: What Avios Actually Are

![British Airways — the biggest airline in the Avios family](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589891459986-e4067c86c351?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

At its core, Avios is a loyalty currency — think of it like air miles, except that it's shared across a whole group of airlines rather than being locked to just one. The name "Avios" has been around since 2011, when British Airways merged its old BA Miles programme with Iberia's. The idea was to create a single, flexible currency that could be earned and spent across multiple carriers.

Today, Avios is the common currency for British Airways Executive Club, Iberia Plus, Aer Lingus AerClub, Vueling Club, Qatar Airways Privilege Club, and Finnair Plus. That's six different airline programmes all using the same points. What makes this genuinely useful — rather than just a marketing exercise — is that you can earn Avios with one airline and spend them with any of the others. So if you've been collecting Avios through a UK credit card, you could use those points to book a Qatar Airways Q Suite from Doha, or an Aer Lingus business class flight from Dublin to New York, or a British Airways seat from London to anywhere they fly.

The system also extends beyond just these six airlines. Because British Airways is part of the Oneworld alliance, you can use your Avios to book reward flights on American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Qantas, and a dozen other carriers. That's what makes Avios one of the most versatile loyalty currencies in the world — it's not just a British Airways thing.

## What's an Avios Actually Worth?

This is the question that everyone asks, and the honest answer is that it completely depends on how you use them. There's no fixed value — one Avios could be worth half a penny or three pence, depending on what you redeem it for.

The general benchmark most people use is around 1p per Avios. If you're consistently getting at least that much value from your redemptions, you're doing well. But the real sweet spot comes when you use Avios for expensive flights — particularly long-haul business and first class — where the value per point can be exceptional.

Let me give you a concrete example. A short-haul economy flight from London to Dublin might cost 13,000 Avios plus about £1 in taxes. If the same ticket costs £80 in cash, you're getting roughly 0.6p per Avios. That's okay, but nothing to write home about. Now consider a business class flight from London to New York, which typically costs around 60,000 Avios plus £600 in taxes and surcharges. If the cash fare for that same business class seat is £2,500, your Avios are effectively worth about 3.2p each. That's over five times more value from the same currency, just by choosing a different redemption.

The takeaway here is straightforward: Avios deliver the best value when you use them for flights that would be prohibitively expensive to pay cash for. Using them on a £40 Ryanair-priced route doesn't make much sense. Using them on a £3,000 business class seat absolutely does.

## How to Earn Avios

There are plenty of ways to build an Avios balance, and most people end up using a combination of methods. The key is understanding which approaches give you the most points for the least effort.

![Every flight on BA or Oneworld partners earns Avios](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541938341575-d7fd71601ddd?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

**Credit cards** are by far the fastest route to a large Avios balance for most people. In the UK, the British Airways American Express earns Avios directly on every purchase, typically at a rate of 1 to 1.5 Avios per pound spent. The sign-up bonuses alone can be worth 25,000 Avios or more. The Amex Preferred Rewards Gold is another popular option — it earns Membership Rewards points that transfer to Avios at a 1:1 ratio, and it comes with a generous sign-up bonus. If you put £2,000 a month of regular spending on one of these cards, you'll accumulate roughly 24,000 Avios per year before any bonuses. That's enough for several short-haul flights or a meaningful contribution towards a long-haul redemption.

**Flying** is the traditional way to earn, of course. Every flight on British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, or any Oneworld partner earns Avios based on the route distance and your cabin class. A London to New York economy flight earns around 4,500 Avios, while the same route in business class earns roughly 9,000. The important thing to remember is that you can credit flights on any Oneworld airline to your BA Executive Club account — so even if you're flying American Airlines domestically in the US or Cathay Pacific across Asia, those flights can add to your Avios balance.

**Shopping portals and partners** provide a steady drip of bonus Avios on purchases you'd make anyway. The BA Shopping portal offers 2 to 15 Avios per pound at hundreds of online retailers, layered on top of whatever your credit card already earns. Nectar points from Sainsbury's transfer to Avios (400 Nectar = 250 Avios), and hotel stays with Marriott Bonvoy or Hyatt can also generate Avios. Individually, these are small amounts, but they compound nicely over time.

**Purchasing directly or topping up** is an option when you're close to having enough Avios for a specific booking. British Airways sells Avios on their website, though the pricing isn't always competitive. Balance Boost offers better rates if you've had recent earning activity. And top-up services like MilesTopUp can transfer Avios to your account within 24–48 hours at competitive rates — useful when you've found the perfect award seat and just need a few thousand more points to book it. We covered every purchase option in detail in our guide to the cheapest ways to get Avios in 2026.

## Spending Avios: Where the Real Value Is

This is where it gets genuinely exciting. The whole point of accumulating Avios is to use them for flights you wouldn't otherwise pay cash for, and there are some truly outstanding redemptions available if you know where to look.

![Business class lie-flat seats — where Avios deliver exceptional value](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1700811476954-1a2faa44a4a5?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

The primary use case is booking reward flights. Through ba.com, you can search and book flights on British Airways and all of their Oneworld partners. Pricing is based on route distance and cabin class. A one-way economy flight within Europe starts at around 9,500 Avios during off-peak periods. London to New York in economy runs about 26,000 Avios one-way, while business class on the same route is 60,000 Avios. For the ultimate splurge, first class from London to destinations like Cape Town or Singapore costs around 102,000 Avios.

There's one important caveat that catches people off guard: on top of your Avios, you also pay taxes, fees, and fuel surcharges. On British Airways flights specifically, these surcharges can be substantial — sometimes £400 or more on a long-haul return in business class. This is arguably BA's biggest drawback as a programme. The good news is that other airlines in the Avios family charge far less. If you book the exact same Oneworld partner flight through Iberia's website using your Avios, the surcharges are often dramatically lower. An Aer Lingus transatlantic business class booking might come with just £50 in fees versus £400+ through BA. Same seat, same Avios cost, vastly different cash outlay. This is one of the most valuable tricks in the Avios ecosystem.

Beyond flights, you can also use Avios to upgrade an existing cash ticket to a higher cabin, combine Avios and cash on the same booking through BA's "part-pay" slider, or redeem for hotel stays through the Executive Club portal. In practice, though, flights are where the value is. Hotel redemptions through Avios tend to offer poor value compared to using hotel loyalty programmes directly.

## The Sweet Spots Every Avios Collector Should Know

Certain Avios redemptions stand head and shoulders above the rest, and knowing about them can be the difference between getting decent value and getting spectacular value.

**Qatar Airways Q Suites** are widely considered the best business class product in the world, and they're bookable with Avios. A one-way flight from Doha to destinations across Asia, Africa, or the Americas costs between 42,500 and 75,000 Avios with minimal surcharges. When the equivalent cash fare is often £3,000 or more, the maths is extraordinary.

**Aer Lingus transatlantic** flights from Dublin to US cities in business class cost 50,000 Avios with very low surcharges. If you can position yourself to Dublin — even factoring in a cheap Ryanair flight — this is one of the best value redemptions in the entire programme.

**Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines** across Asia also deserve special mention. Using Avios on these carriers means minimal surcharges and access to genuinely world-class business and first class products. A Cathay Pacific business class flight from Hong Kong to London for 75,000 Avios with under £50 in taxes is remarkable value when the walk-up fare can exceed £4,000.

**Off-peak short-haul** flights within Europe at 9,500 Avios one-way are the unsung heroes for frequent travellers. A weekend in Barcelona or a quick trip to Dublin for less than 10,000 Avios — when the cash fare might be £100 or more — adds up to significant savings over the course of a year.

## Do Avios Expire?

Avios expire after 36 months of inactivity, meaning if you don't earn or spend a single Avios for three years, your entire balance is wiped. That sounds harsh, but in practice it's easy to avoid. Almost any activity resets the 36-month clock — a single credit card transaction that earns Avios, a small purchase through the shopping portal, transferring one Avios point between household accounts, or even just collecting Avios from a Nectar conversion.

My advice is to set a calendar reminder for every 30 months. If you haven't had any Avios activity by then, do something small to reset the timer. It would be a shame to lose a balance you've spent years building.

## How Avios Stack Up Against the Competition

![Planning your loyalty strategy — Avios vs other programmes](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1655722724170-b3ab67a48791?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

No loyalty currency exists in a vacuum, so it's worth understanding how Avios compare to the alternatives. If you're based in Europe, the two most relevant competitors are Flying Blue (Air France/KLM) and Virgin Atlantic Points.

Flying Blue beats Avios for intra-European flights — their pricing starts at just 4,000 miles one-way compared to 9,500 Avios, and they run monthly Promo Rewards with 25–50% discounts. For short-haul European travel, Flying Blue is simply better value. Where Avios pull ahead is on long-haul premium cabins, particularly through partners like Qatar Airways and Cathay Pacific that Flying Blue can't access. The smart approach, if you're serious about award travel, is to collect both currencies and use each where it's strongest.

Virgin Atlantic Points are excellent for specific use cases — particularly Upper Class to the US or Delta One flights — but the programme is far more limited in scope. Virgin's partner network is tiny compared to Oneworld, which means your redemption options are far more constrained.

Lufthansa Miles & More deserves a mention mostly as a cautionary tale. The programme has famously poor redemption rates, high surcharges, and limited award availability. If you're choosing between accumulating Miles & More and Avios, it's not a close contest.

Overall, Avios are arguably the most versatile loyalty currency available to travellers based in the UK and Europe. The combination of British Airways' extensive network, Oneworld alliance access, and the ability to use points across six different airline programmes makes them genuinely hard to beat.

## Getting Started with Avios

If you've read this far and you're convinced that Avios are worth collecting, here's the practical bit. Start by joining the BA Executive Club — it's completely free and takes about two minutes on ba.com. Then consider picking up an Avios-earning credit card, which will be your primary accumulation engine. Link your BA, Iberia, and Aer Lingus accounts so you can freely move Avios between them and book through whichever programme offers the best surcharges.

Most importantly, set a goal. Decide where you want to fly, figure out how many Avios you'll need, and work backwards from there. Building a meaningful balance typically takes 6 to 12 months of focused earning — but when you're stretching out in a lie-flat business class seat on a flight you effectively paid for with your supermarket shopping, the whole exercise feels very much worth the effort.`,
