    title: "The Cheapest Way to Get Avios Points in 2026: Every Option Compared",
    excerpt: "From Balance Boost at under 1p per Avios to direct purchases at 2.45p — we break down every method to top up your Avios balance and what each one actually costs.",
    content: `If you need Avios for an award booking, the worst thing you can do is panic-buy at full price from ba.com. The price difference between the cheapest and most expensive method of topping up your Avios balance is genuinely staggering — we're talking 0.92p versus 2.45p per Avios, which means you could be paying nearly three times more for the exact same points simply by choosing the wrong option.

The good news is that there are several ways to get Avios at a reasonable price, and some of them are remarkably cheap if you know where to look. I've ranked every method available in 2026 from cheapest to most expensive, with an honest assessment of who each option actually works for.

## 1. Avios Balance Boost — From 0.92p per Avios

![British Airways — the home of Avios points](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584084807193-bed442df7a75?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

Balance Boost is the cheapest standard way to get Avios for most people, and it's a feature that doesn't get nearly enough attention. The way it works is straightforward: BA allows you to purchase additional Avios equal to 100%, 200%, or 300% of the Avios you've earned in the previous 30 days. So if you earned 10,000 Avios from a flight or credit card spend last month, you can boost your balance by up to 30,000 additional Avios at just 0.92p each. That works out to £276 for 30,000 Avios — genuinely hard to beat anywhere.

The catch is that you need recent earning activity for the option to appear. If you haven't earned any Avios in the last 30 days, Balance Boost simply won't show up in your account. There's also an annual cap of 300,000 Avios at this price point, after which the rate jumps to 1.77p. The smart play is to plan your earning activity ahead of a big booking — make sure you've had a credit card transaction or flight credit within the last month, then use Balance Boost to top up at the best possible rate.

## 2. Avios Subscription — From 0.99p per Avios

This is a relatively newer option from BA that works like a monthly direct debit for Avios. You commit to one of four tiers — ranging from 20,000 to 200,000 Avios per year — and receive your points in monthly instalments. If you opt for annual payment rather than monthly billing, you effectively get about two months free, bringing the cost down to roughly 0.99p per Avios on the larger plans.

The obvious limitation here is that your Avios arrive gradually rather than as a lump sum. If you've found a perfect award seat and need 50,000 Avios next week, the subscription isn't going to help. It's very much a long-game strategy for people who know they'll be redeeming regularly and want to steadily build a balance over time without thinking about it.

## 3. Credit Card Sign-Up Bonuses — Effective Cost Under 1p

![Credit card rewards are the fastest way to earn Avios](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556742049-0cfed4f6a45d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

If you're based in the UK and you're not using a credit card to earn Avios, you're leaving significant value on the table. The BA American Express cards offer welcome bonuses of 25,000 Avios or more, and the Amex Preferred Rewards Gold earns Membership Rewards points that transfer 1:1 to Avios with its own generous sign-up bonus on top.

When you factor the annual fee against the bonus points, the effective cost per Avios often works out under 1p — and sometimes as low as 0.5p if you were going to make the minimum spend anyway. The downside is that this requires a credit application, meeting minimum spend targets (typically £3,000–5,000 in three months), and paying annual fees that range from £195 to £450 depending on the card. It's not instant gratification, but for UK residents who can meet the spend requirements, credit card bonuses remain the single best long-term strategy for accumulating large Avios balances.

## 4. Finnair Plus Promotions — From ~1.05p per Avios

Here's one that a lot of people overlook. Finnair runs regular promotions where you can purchase Avios through their Finnair Plus programme. Since Finnair joined the Avios family, their points are the same currency — meaning you can buy Avios through Finnair and then transfer them to your British Airways Executive Club account by linking the two programmes.

During the best promotions, particularly the 50% discount deals that come around several times a year, prices drop to around 1.05p per Avios. That's exceptional value for a direct purchase with no strings attached. The main drawback is that promotions are irregular and you can't count on them being available when you need them. You also need a Finnair Plus account, and the transfer to BA requires linking your accounts through the Avios system. It's not complicated, but it's an extra step that puts some people off. For opportunistic buyers who check regularly and are happy to jump on deals when they appear, this is one of the best options available.

## 5. Qatar Airways Privilege Club — From ~1.75p per Avios

![Qatar Airways Q Suites — bookable with Avios](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684929167916-a844fcf314d7?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

Qatar Airways also uses Avios as their loyalty currency and periodically runs purchase promotions through the Privilege Club. Standard pricing starts around 1.75p per Avios, which isn't cheap, but bonus offers can bring this down to more reasonable territory. Prices are typically quoted in USD, so exchange rates matter for UK-based buyers and can work either for or against you depending on when you purchase.

Promotions from Qatar tend to be less frequent than Finnair's, so this isn't something you can rely on as a regular source of cheap Avios. But when Qatar does run a strong promotion and other options aren't available, it's worth considering.

## 6. Buy Directly from BA — 1.77p to 2.45p per Avios

The official ba.com purchase page is the most straightforward option but also comfortably the most expensive. Prices range from £49 for 2,000 Avios (working out to 2.45p each) down to £3,539 for 200,000 Avios (1.77p each at the bulk rate). Even that bulk rate is nearly double what you'd pay through Balance Boost, which tells you everything you need to know about the value proposition here.

Buying directly from BA really only makes sense as a last resort — when no other option is available and you need Avios right now for a booking that won't wait. Before you click that buy button, make sure you've checked every other method on this list first.

## 7. Use a Top-Up Service — Competitive Rates, Fast Delivery

Services like MilesTopUp offer an alternative approach: they transfer Avios directly to your account using credit card points transfer mechanisms. You request a personalised quote based on the quantity you need, pay, and the miles typically arrive within 24–48 hours.

The main advantage here is consistency and convenience. You get competitive rates without having to wait for airline promotions to come around, and there's no requirement for recent earning activity like Balance Boost demands. Top-up services are particularly useful for larger orders where you need a specific number of Avios at a predictable price and don't want to jump through hoops to get them. It's worth getting a quote to compare against whatever other options are available to you at the time.

## Which Method Is Right for You?

![Choosing the right method depends on your timeline](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1699810917663-2341cd65afee?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

The right approach depends entirely on your timeline and situation. If you have several months before you need to book, the unbeatable combination is credit card bonuses plus Balance Boost — earn Avios through your everyday spending, then use Balance Boost at 0.92p to top up your balance to wherever it needs to be. No other method comes close to this on a cost-per-point basis.

If you need Avios within the next few weeks, start by checking whether Finnair or Qatar have any active promotions running. If they do, take advantage. If they don't, a top-up service gives you a reliable price and fast delivery without the uncertainty of waiting for a promotion to appear.

If you need Avios right now — as in today or tomorrow — your options narrow to a top-up service (24–48 hours) or buying directly from BA (instant but expensive). The price difference between these two can be significant, so it's always worth getting a quote before defaulting to the BA website.

If you're still getting to grips with what Avios actually are and how the whole system works, our [complete beginner's guide to Avios](/blog/what-are-avios-beginners-guide) covers everything from earning strategies to the best redemption sweet spots.

One final piece of advice: never get Avios speculatively. Only top up when you have a specific booking in mind and know exactly how many points you need. It's also worth checking the Avios-plus-cash combinations on ba.com, where you can slide a bar to mix points and money on the same booking. Sometimes paying a bit more cash and fewer Avios turns out to be the smarter play.`,

    title: "How to Get Flying Blue Miles in 2026: The Complete Guide",
    excerpt: "Everything you need to know about earning, buying, and maximising Flying Blue miles — from monthly Promo Rewards to transfer partners and sweet spot redemptions.",
    content: `Flying Blue is the loyalty programme of Air France and KLM, and for travellers based in Europe, it's arguably the single most valuable frequent flyer programme to understand. The reason is simple: intra-European award flights start at just 4,000 miles one-way, and every month the programme releases discounted award seats with 25–50% off the standard mileage cost. There's genuinely nothing else like it in the European loyalty landscape.

The challenge, of course, is having enough miles in your account when you spot the perfect award flight. That's what this guide is about — every practical way to build your Flying Blue balance, plus where to spend those miles for maximum value.

## What Makes Flying Blue Worth Your Attention

![KLM — one of the two airlines behind Flying Blue](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1742429577899-369b2c19230d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

Before diving into the earning strategies, it's worth understanding what makes Flying Blue genuinely stand apart from the competition. The headline feature is the pricing for intra-European flights. A one-way economy award within Europe costs between 4,000 and 8,000 Flying Blue miles — try finding anything comparable in British Airways Executive Club (where the equivalent starts at 9,500 Avios) or virtually any other European programme.

Then there are the Monthly Promo Rewards, which are Flying Blue's killer feature and something no other major programme offers consistently. Around the first week of every month, Air France and KLM publish a selection of discounted award flights with 25–50% off the standard mileage pricing. A business class flight from Amsterdam to New York that normally costs 70,000 miles might drop to 50,000 during a promo. These deals are available across all cabins — economy, premium economy, and business — and they genuinely transform what's possible with a relatively modest miles balance.

Your Flying Blue miles also give you access to the entire SkyTeam alliance, which means they work on Air France, KLM, Delta, Korean Air, Vietnam Airlines, and more. That's comprehensive global coverage. And unlike some programmes where points expire on a fixed schedule regardless of activity, Flying Blue miles stay alive as long as you earn or spend at least one mile every 24 months.

## Earning Through Credit Card Transfers

![Transfer credit card points to Flying Blue for instant miles](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1646992914433-de93d0d06c98?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

The fastest and most efficient way to build a substantial Flying Blue balance is through credit card points transfers. All of the major flexible points programmes — American Express Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Citi ThankYou Rewards, Capital One Miles, and Bilt Rewards — transfer to Flying Blue at a 1:1 ratio. Marriott Bonvoy points also transfer, though at a 3:1 ratio (with a 5,000-mile bonus when you transfer 60,000 Bonvoy points or more).

What makes this particularly powerful is that transfers from Amex, Chase, and Citi are typically instant. That means you can search for an award flight on the Flying Blue website, confirm that the seat you want is available, transfer exactly the number of miles you need from your credit card programme, and complete the booking — all within minutes. There's no waiting around and no risk of the availability disappearing while your miles are in transit.

The real power move, though, is watching for transfer bonuses. Amex and Chase occasionally run promotions offering 20–30% bonus miles on transfers to Flying Blue. When one of these promotions is active, every 10,000 points you transfer becomes 12,000 or 13,000 Flying Blue miles. If you've been accumulating credit card points and waiting for the right moment to move them, a transfer bonus is exactly that moment.

## Earning Through Flying

Every flight on Air France, KLM, or any SkyTeam partner airline earns Flying Blue miles based on your ticket price rather than distance. At the base Explorer level (no status), you earn 4 miles per euro spent on the ticket. This increases to 6 miles per euro with Silver status, 7 with Gold, and 8 with Platinum.

To put that in practical terms, a €500 round-trip flight from Paris to New York in economy earns about 2,000 miles at the base level. That's not going to fill your account overnight, but it adds up meaningfully if you're a regular flyer on Air France, KLM, or SkyTeam routes. And of course, you're earning these miles on flights you'd be taking anyway.

## The Monthly Promo Rewards

![Air France business class — bookable at a discount during Promo Rewards](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1719405524195-c3a331daa84f?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

This deserves its own section because it's genuinely Flying Blue's most distinctive and valuable feature. Around the first week of each month, Air France and KLM publish a list of routes where award flights are available at a significant discount — typically 25% to 50% off the standard mileage price. The discounts apply across all cabins, and they must be booked by the end of the month.

The key to taking advantage of Promo Rewards is being prepared and acting fast. Set a calendar reminder for the 5th of every month and check the promo page as soon as it updates. The best availability — particularly in business class — tends to go within days. A recent example from February 2026 included 25% off on routes between Europe and the US, which brought business class redemptions from Amsterdam or Paris to New York down from the standard 70,000 miles to roughly 50,000. When you consider that the cash fare for that same business class seat is often €2,000 or more, the value is extraordinary.

## Partner Earning and Shopping Portals

Flying Blue has partnerships with a range of hotels, car rental companies, and shopping portals that provide additional earning opportunities. Booking.com offers 2 miles per euro spent plus periodic bonus promotions of 15–30%, and Hyatt awards 500 miles per qualifying stay. On the car rental side, Hertz offers up to 12 miles per euro on electric vehicle rentals. The Air France and KLM shopping portals provide bonus miles at hundreds of online retailers.

None of these individual partnerships are going to transform your miles balance on their own, but they represent free miles on spending you'd likely be doing anyway. Over the course of a year, the cumulative effect of earning through shopping portals, hotel stays, and partner programmes can be surprisingly meaningful.

## Buying Miles or Using a Top-Up Service

Sometimes you find the perfect award seat — maybe it's a Promo Reward business class flight to New York at a discounted rate — but you're 10,000 or 20,000 miles short of being able to book it. Waiting to earn those miles through flying or credit card spending means watching that seat disappear.

Air France and KLM do sell Flying Blue miles directly, though the pricing varies and typically falls in the range of 1.5–3 cents per mile depending on quantity and any active promotions. It's worth checking the Flying Blue website for current rates before purchasing. Top-up services like MilesTopUp offer an alternative: they can add Flying Blue miles to your account within 24–48 hours at competitive rates based on a personalised quote. This approach is worth considering when you need a specific number of miles quickly and the airline's own pricing isn't favourable.

The important thing is to only buy or top up miles when you have a specific booking in mind. Calculate the cost of the additional miles against what you'd pay for the cash fare, and make sure the maths works in your favour. As a general rule, if you're getting more than 1.5 cents of value per mile on the redemption, topping up makes sense.

## Family Pooling

One of Flying Blue's most underappreciated features is the ability to pool miles across up to 8 accounts. This is a genuine game-changer for families and couples — instead of each person slowly accumulating their own small balance, you can combine everyone's earning into a single pool and reach redemption thresholds much faster.

Setting up family pooling is free through the Flying Blue website. Each member continues to earn miles into their own account, but the combined balance becomes accessible for bookings by any member of the pool. If you have a partner, children, or family members who also fly occasionally, this is absolutely worth configuring.

## Where to Spend Flying Blue Miles for Maximum Value

![Flying Blue sweet spots include Paris and Amsterdam routes](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1679231926690-cb1e8abfcefd?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

Understanding where your miles deliver the best value helps you set realistic earning targets and make smarter decisions about when to redeem versus when to save.

For intra-European travel, Flying Blue is virtually unbeatable. One-way economy awards of 4,000–8,000 miles cover routes like Amsterdam to Rome, Paris to Barcelona, or any number of city-to-city hops across the continent. When the cash fare for these routes regularly exceeds €100, you're getting exceptional value from a very small number of miles.

The transatlantic sweet spot is business class between Europe and North America. A standard award costs 50,000–70,000 miles one-way, but during Promo Rewards this can drop to 35,000–50,000. A lie-flat seat from Paris or Amsterdam to New York for 50,000 miles is outstanding value when the cash fare is often €2,000 or more. This is the redemption that makes the whole Flying Blue ecosystem worth engaging with.

For longer routes to Asia and the Middle East, expect to spend 30,000–50,000 miles one-way in economy for destinations like Dubai or Tokyo. Business class to these destinations requires more, but Promo Rewards can bring the pricing into very attractive territory.

## How Flying Blue Compares

For intra-European travel and Air France/KLM routes, Flying Blue is the clear winner. No other major programme comes close to the 4,000-mile starting price for European flights, and the monthly Promo Rewards add a dimension of value that simply doesn't exist elsewhere.

Where Flying Blue is less competitive is on long-haul premium cabin bookings through partner airlines. British Airways Avios offers access to exceptional products like Qatar Airways Q Suites and Cathay Pacific business class at compelling prices — products that Flying Blue can't match because they're on different alliances. For UK-based travellers, the ideal strategy is honestly to collect both currencies and deploy each where it's strongest.

## Putting It All Together

Building a useful Flying Blue balance is about combining multiple earning strategies rather than relying on any single approach. Start with a flexible points credit card — Amex or Chase — and earn on your everyday spending. Watch for transfer bonus promotions and move points to Flying Blue when the rates are favourable. Check the Promo Rewards page religiously on the first week of every month. Set up family pooling if you have a partner or family who also travel. And when you find a great award seat but you're a few thousand miles short, don't let it slip away — top up the difference rather than watching the availability disappear.

The goal isn't to hoard miles indefinitely. It's to have enough in the bank when that perfect award seat appears — and to be ready to book it before someone else does. And if you're weighing up whether Flying Blue or Avios is the better programme for your travel style, we've written a detailed [Avios vs Flying Blue comparison](/blog/avios-vs-flying-blue-which-miles-should-you-get) that breaks down exactly where each currency shines.`,

    excerpt: "Avios are the loyalty currency used by British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, Qatar Airways and more. Here's everything you need to know — what they're worth, how to earn them, and how to use them.",
    content: `You've probably heard people talk about Avios. Maybe a colleague casually mentioned flying business class to New York "basically for free," or you spotted the word on your British Airways booking confirmation and wondered what it actually meant. Perhaps you've got a few thousand sitting in an Executive Club account somewhere and never really thought about what to do with them.

Whatever brought you here, this guide is going to walk you through everything — what Avios are, why they matter, how the whole system works, and most importantly, how to make the most of them. I'll try to keep things practical and honest rather than drowning you in jargon.

## The Basics: What Avios Actually Are

![British Airways — the biggest airline in the Avios family](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589891459986-e4067c86c351?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

At its core, Avios is a loyalty currency — think of it like air miles, except that it's shared across a whole group of airlines rather than being locked to just one. The name "Avios" has been around since 2011, when British Airways merged its old BA Miles programme with Iberia's. The idea was to create a single, flexible currency that could be earned and spent across multiple carriers.

Today, Avios is the common currency for British Airways Executive Club, Iberia Plus, Aer Lingus AerClub, Vueling Club, Qatar Airways Privilege Club, and Finnair Plus. That's six different airline programmes all using the same points. What makes this genuinely useful — rather than just a marketing exercise — is that you can earn Avios with one airline and spend them with any of the others. So if you've been collecting Avios through a UK credit card, you could use those points to book a Qatar Airways Q Suite from Doha, or an Aer Lingus business class flight from Dublin to New York, or a British Airways seat from London to anywhere they fly.

The system also extends beyond just these six airlines. Because British Airways is part of the Oneworld alliance, you can use your Avios to book reward flights on American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Qantas, and a dozen other carriers. That's what makes Avios one of the most versatile loyalty currencies in the world — it's not just a British Airways thing.

## What's an Avios Actually Worth?

This is the question that everyone asks, and the honest answer is that it completely depends on how you use them. There's no fixed value — one Avios could be worth half a penny or three pence, depending on what you redeem it for.

The general benchmark most people use is around 1p per Avios. If you're consistently getting at least that much value from your redemptions, you're doing well. But the real sweet spot comes when you use Avios for expensive flights — particularly long-haul business and first class — where the value per point can be exceptional.

Let me give you a concrete example. A short-haul economy flight from London to Dublin might cost 13,000 Avios plus about £1 in taxes. If the same ticket costs £80 in cash, you're getting roughly 0.6p per Avios. That's okay, but nothing to write home about. Now consider a business class flight from London to New York, which typically costs around 60,000 Avios plus £600 in taxes and surcharges. If the cash fare for that same business class seat is £2,500, your Avios are effectively worth about 3.2p each. That's over five times more value from the same currency, just by choosing a different redemption.

The takeaway here is straightforward: Avios deliver the best value when you use them for flights that would be prohibitively expensive to pay cash for. Using them on a £40 Ryanair-priced route doesn't make much sense. Using them on a £3,000 business class seat absolutely does.

## How to Earn Avios

There are plenty of ways to build an Avios balance, and most people end up using a combination of methods. The key is understanding which approaches give you the most points for the least effort.

![Every flight on BA or Oneworld partners earns Avios](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541938341575-d7fd71601ddd?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

**Credit cards** are by far the fastest route to a large Avios balance for most people. In the UK, the British Airways American Express earns Avios directly on every purchase, typically at a rate of 1 to 1.5 Avios per pound spent. The sign-up bonuses alone can be worth 25,000 Avios or more. The Amex Preferred Rewards Gold is another popular option — it earns Membership Rewards points that transfer to Avios at a 1:1 ratio, and it comes with a generous sign-up bonus. If you put £2,000 a month of regular spending on one of these cards, you'll accumulate roughly 24,000 Avios per year before any bonuses. That's enough for several short-haul flights or a meaningful contribution towards a long-haul redemption.

**Flying** is the traditional way to earn, of course. Every flight on British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, or any Oneworld partner earns Avios based on the route distance and your cabin class. A London to New York economy flight earns around 4,500 Avios, while the same route in business class earns roughly 9,000. The important thing to remember is that you can credit flights on any Oneworld airline to your BA Executive Club account — so even if you're flying American Airlines domestically in the US or Cathay Pacific across Asia, those flights can add to your Avios balance.

**Shopping portals and partners** provide a steady drip of bonus Avios on purchases you'd make anyway. The BA Shopping portal offers 2 to 15 Avios per pound at hundreds of online retailers, layered on top of whatever your credit card already earns. Nectar points from Sainsbury's transfer to Avios (400 Nectar = 250 Avios), and hotel stays with Marriott Bonvoy or Hyatt can also generate Avios. Individually, these are small amounts, but they compound nicely over time.

**Purchasing directly or topping up** is an option when you're close to having enough Avios for a specific booking. British Airways sells Avios on their website, though the pricing isn't always competitive. Balance Boost offers better rates if you've had recent earning activity. And top-up services like MilesTopUp can transfer Avios to your account within 24–48 hours at competitive rates — useful when you've found the perfect award seat and just need a few thousand more points to book it. We covered every purchase option in detail in our [guide to the cheapest ways to get Avios in 2026](/blog/cheapest-way-to-get-avios-2026).

## Spending Avios: Where the Real Value Is

This is where it gets genuinely exciting. The whole point of accumulating Avios is to use them for flights you wouldn't otherwise pay cash for, and there are some truly outstanding redemptions available if you know where to look.

![Business class lie-flat seats — where Avios deliver exceptional value](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1700811476954-1a2faa44a4a5?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

The primary use case is booking reward flights. Through ba.com, you can search and book flights on British Airways and all of their Oneworld partners. Pricing is based on route distance and cabin class. A one-way economy flight within Europe starts at around 9,500 Avios during off-peak periods. London to New York in economy runs about 26,000 Avios one-way, while business class on the same route is 60,000 Avios. For the ultimate splurge, first class from London to destinations like Cape Town or Singapore costs around 102,000 Avios.

There's one important caveat that catches people off guard: on top of your Avios, you also pay taxes, fees, and fuel surcharges. On British Airways flights specifically, these surcharges can be substantial — sometimes £400 or more on a long-haul return in business class. This is arguably BA's biggest drawback as a programme. The good news is that other airlines in the Avios family charge far less. If you book the exact same Oneworld partner flight through Iberia's website using your Avios, the surcharges are often dramatically lower. An Aer Lingus transatlantic business class booking might come with just £50 in fees versus £400+ through BA. Same seat, same Avios cost, vastly different cash outlay. This is one of the most valuable tricks in the Avios ecosystem.

Beyond flights, you can also use Avios to upgrade an existing cash ticket to a higher cabin, combine Avios and cash on the same booking through BA's "part-pay" slider, or redeem for hotel stays through the Executive Club portal. In practice, though, flights are where the value is. Hotel redemptions through Avios tend to offer poor value compared to using hotel loyalty programmes directly.

## The Sweet Spots Every Avios Collector Should Know

Certain Avios redemptions stand head and shoulders above the rest, and knowing about them can be the difference between getting decent value and getting spectacular value.

**Qatar Airways Q Suites** are widely considered the best business class product in the world, and they're bookable with Avios. A one-way flight from Doha to destinations across Asia, Africa, or the Americas costs between 42,500 and 75,000 Avios with minimal surcharges. When the equivalent cash fare is often £3,000 or more, the maths is extraordinary.

**Aer Lingus transatlantic** flights from Dublin to US cities in business class cost 50,000 Avios with very low surcharges. If you can position yourself to Dublin — even factoring in a cheap Ryanair flight — this is one of the best value redemptions in the entire programme.

**Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines** across Asia also deserve special mention. Using Avios on these carriers means minimal surcharges and access to genuinely world-class business and first class products. A Cathay Pacific business class flight from Hong Kong to London for 75,000 Avios with under £50 in taxes is remarkable value when the walk-up fare can exceed £4,000.

**Off-peak short-haul** flights within Europe at 9,500 Avios one-way are the unsung heroes for frequent travellers. A weekend in Barcelona or a quick trip to Dublin for less than 10,000 Avios — when the cash fare might be £100 or more — adds up to significant savings over the course of a year.

## Do Avios Expire?

Avios expire after 36 months of inactivity, meaning if you don't earn or spend a single Avios for three years, your entire balance is wiped. That sounds harsh, but in practice it's easy to avoid. Almost any activity resets the 36-month clock — a single credit card transaction that earns Avios, a small purchase through the shopping portal, transferring one Avios point between household accounts, or even just collecting Avios from a Nectar conversion.

My advice is to set a calendar reminder for every 30 months. If you haven't had any Avios activity by then, do something small to reset the timer. It would be a shame to lose a balance you've spent years building.

## How Avios Stack Up Against the Competition

![Planning your loyalty strategy — Avios vs other programmes](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1655722724170-b3ab67a48791?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

No loyalty currency exists in a vacuum, so it's worth understanding how Avios compare to the alternatives. If you're based in Europe, the two most relevant competitors are Flying Blue (Air France/KLM) and Virgin Atlantic Points.

Flying Blue beats Avios for intra-European flights — their pricing starts at just 4,000 miles one-way compared to 9,500 Avios, and they run monthly Promo Rewards with 25–50% discounts. For short-haul European travel, Flying Blue is simply better value. If you want the full picture on Flying Blue, we've written a [complete guide to getting Flying Blue miles](/blog/how-to-get-flying-blue-miles-guide) that covers everything from Promo Rewards to transfer partners. Where Avios pull ahead is on long-haul premium cabins, particularly through partners like Qatar Airways and Cathay Pacific that Flying Blue can't access. The smart approach, if you're serious about award travel, is to collect both currencies and use each where it's strongest.

Virgin Atlantic Points are excellent for specific use cases — particularly Upper Class to the US or Delta One flights — but the programme is far more limited in scope. Virgin's partner network is tiny compared to Oneworld, which means your redemption options are far more constrained.

Lufthansa Miles & More deserves a mention mostly as a cautionary tale. The programme has famously poor redemption rates, high surcharges, and limited award availability. If you're choosing between accumulating Miles & More and Avios, it's not a close contest.

Overall, Avios are arguably the most versatile loyalty currency available to travellers based in the UK and Europe. The combination of British Airways' extensive network, Oneworld alliance access, and the ability to use points across six different airline programmes makes them genuinely hard to beat.

## Getting Started with Avios

If you've read this far and you're convinced that Avios are worth collecting, here's the practical bit. Start by joining the BA Executive Club — it's completely free and takes about two minutes on ba.com. Then consider picking up an Avios-earning credit card, which will be your primary accumulation engine. Link your BA, Iberia, and Aer Lingus accounts so you can freely move Avios between them and book through whichever programme offers the best surcharges.

Most importantly, set a goal. Decide where you want to fly, figure out how many Avios you'll need, and work backwards from there. Building a meaningful balance typically takes 6 to 12 months of focused earning — but when you're stretching out in a lie-flat business class seat on a flight you effectively paid for with your supermarket shopping, the whole exercise feels very much worth the effort.`,

    excerpt: "British Airways Avios and Air France/KLM Flying Blue are the two most valuable loyalty currencies in Europe — but they excel in very different areas. Here's an honest comparison to help you decide which to focus on.",
    content: `If you're based in Europe and you're serious about using miles for award flights, you've almost certainly encountered the same dilemma I did a few years ago: should you collect Avios or Flying Blue miles? Both programmes are genuinely excellent — arguably the two best loyalty currencies available to European travellers — but they have very different strengths, and the right choice depends entirely on how and where you like to travel.

I've spent a lot of time with both programmes, and I can tell you upfront that the answer for most people isn't actually "one or the other." It's both. But that doesn't mean they're interchangeable, and understanding where each one excels will save you from making expensive mistakes with your points. So let's break this down properly.

![The two biggest European loyalty programmes compared](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1662155514120-155e4d127132?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

## The Programmes at a Glance

Avios is the shared loyalty currency used by British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, Vueling, Qatar Airways, and Finnair. If you're not familiar with how it all works, our [complete beginner's guide to Avios](/blog/what-are-avios-beginners-guide) walks through the whole ecosystem in detail. Because British Airways is a member of the Oneworld alliance, your Avios can also be used to book flights on American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Qantas, and about a dozen other carriers. The programme is managed through multiple accounts — BA Executive Club, Iberia Plus, Aer Lingus AerClub — and you can move Avios between them freely, which creates some interesting opportunities for optimising surcharges and routing.

Flying Blue is the loyalty programme of Air France and KLM, and it sits within the SkyTeam alliance. That gives you access to Delta, Korean Air, Vietnam Airlines, and several other partners. Unlike the fragmented Avios system, Flying Blue is a single programme with one account, one balance, and one set of rules. It's simpler to manage, and it has some unique features — particularly the Monthly Promo Rewards — that make it genuinely distinctive. We've covered all the earning strategies and sweet spots in our [complete guide to getting Flying Blue miles](/blog/how-to-get-flying-blue-miles-guide).

Both programmes earn miles through flights, credit card transfers (Amex, Chase, Citi, and others all transfer to both), and various shopping partners. Both have reasonable expiration policies — Avios expire after 36 months of inactivity, Flying Blue after 24 months, though in both cases any earning or spending activity resets the clock. And both offer access to genuinely exciting redemptions that can save you thousands of pounds on flights you'd otherwise never be able to afford.

## Short-Haul European Flights: Flying Blue Wins Convincingly

This is the single biggest area where the two programmes diverge, and it's not even close. Flying Blue prices one-way economy flights within Europe starting at just 4,000 miles. Avios, by contrast, starts at 9,500 for the equivalent flight during off-peak periods and can be higher during peak times. That's more than double the cost for essentially the same type of route.

![European city breaks are where Flying Blue delivers unbeatable value](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563463149242-5f4a8b25e18a?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

But the pricing advantage is only part of the story. Flying Blue also runs Monthly Promo Rewards — a feature that genuinely has no equivalent in the Avios world. Around the first week of every month, Air France and KLM publish a selection of routes where award flights are discounted by 25–50%. These promos cover economy, premium economy, and business class, and they can bring already-cheap European flights down to absurdly low mileage costs. A 4,000-mile flight discounted by 50% becomes 2,000 miles. That's barely the cost of a supermarket shop in credit card points.

If you primarily fly within Europe — weekend city breaks, short business trips, visiting family in another European country — Flying Blue is the clear winner and it's not really a debate. You'll get at least twice as many flights from the same number of miles, and the Promo Rewards add another layer of value on top.

The one caveat is that Flying Blue's European award availability can be tighter than Avios, particularly on popular routes during holidays. BA tends to release more award seats on their own metal, so if flexibility of dates matters more to you than the per-flight cost, that's worth factoring in.

## Long-Haul Premium Cabins: Avios Has the Edge

Where Avios truly shines is in getting you into business and first class seats on long-haul flights, particularly through partner airlines. The Oneworld alliance includes some of the best premium cabin products in the world, and they're all bookable with Avios at reasonable rates with manageable surcharges — if you know the tricks.

Qatar Airways Q Suites are widely regarded as the best business class product flying today, and they're bookable with Avios at between 42,500 and 75,000 points one-way depending on the route. The surcharges are minimal when booked through Qatar's own Privilege Club. Cathay Pacific's business class — another phenomenal product — costs 75,000 Avios from Hong Kong to London with under £50 in taxes. Japan Airlines, Qantas, and American Airlines all offer competitive redemption rates through Avios as well.

Flying Blue can't match this breadth of premium cabin access. SkyTeam has some excellent products — Korean Air's first class is spectacular, and Delta One is solid — but the overall selection of world-class business and first class products is narrower than what Oneworld offers. Air France and KLM's own business class is perfectly good but doesn't quite reach the heights of Qatar's Q Suites or Cathay's latest cabins.

![Long-haul business class — where Avios redemptions deliver the most value](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1700811476954-1a2faa44a5a5?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

There's also the surcharge question. British Airways is notorious for adding hefty fuel surcharges to award tickets on their own flights — sometimes £400 or more on a long-haul return. But here's the thing that experienced Avios collectors know: you can avoid most of these surcharges by booking through Iberia Plus or Aer Lingus AerClub instead of BA Executive Club. The same Oneworld partner flight, same Avios cost, dramatically lower cash outlay. Flying Blue's surcharges on Air France and KLM metal are more moderate and predictable, which is simpler but doesn't offer the same optimisation opportunities.

## Transatlantic Flights: It Depends on Your Route

For flights between Europe and North America — probably the most popular long-haul redemption for European travellers — both programmes offer compelling options, and the winner depends on your specific routing.

Flying Blue is exceptional for flights from Amsterdam or Paris to US cities. A standard one-way business class award costs 50,000–72,000 miles, but during Monthly Promo Rewards this can drop to 35,000–55,000. When you consider that a cash business class fare on Air France or KLM to New York is often €2,000–3,000, the value is extraordinary. The Promo Rewards make Flying Blue the clear winner if you can be flexible with your dates and are happy to route through Amsterdam or Paris.

Avios counters with more route options. BA flies from London to a huge number of US destinations, and through American Airlines you can reach virtually anywhere in the Americas. The Aer Lingus transatlantic route from Dublin is a particular sweet spot — 50,000 Avios one-way in business class with very low surcharges. If you can position yourself to Dublin cheaply, this is one of the best-value transatlantic redemptions in any programme. We covered the full pricing breakdown in our [guide to the cheapest ways to get Avios](/blog/cheapest-way-to-get-avios-2026).

## Earning Miles: A Virtual Tie

Both programmes benefit from the same credit card transfer ecosystem, which makes the earning side largely equivalent. Amex Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, and Citi ThankYou points all transfer to both Avios and Flying Blue at a 1:1 ratio. This means you can accumulate flexible points and then decide at the moment of booking which programme to transfer them to — which is honestly the smartest strategy.

Where things differ slightly is in co-branded credit cards. In the UK, the BA Amex cards earn Avios directly and are among the most popular travel credit cards available. There's no equivalent direct-earning Flying Blue credit card in the UK market. In the Netherlands and France, the situation is reversed — there are co-branded Flying Blue cards that earn miles directly.

Transfer bonuses are worth watching for both programmes. Amex and Chase periodically offer 20–30% bonus miles on transfers to both Avios and Flying Blue, and timing your transfers to coincide with these promotions can meaningfully stretch your points balance.

## Getting More Miles When You Need Them

Both programmes sell miles directly, though the pricing and frequency of promotions varies. Avios has more options here — Balance Boost offers rates as low as 0.92p per Avios if you've had recent earning activity, the Avios Subscription provides a monthly drip at competitive rates, and Finnair regularly runs purchase promotions. Flying Blue's direct purchase pricing is less consistent, and they don't have an equivalent to Balance Boost.

If you need to top up your balance for a specific booking, services like MilesTopUp can add either Avios or Flying Blue miles to your account within 24–48 hours, which is useful when you've found the perfect award seat and just need a few thousand more points to secure it.

## Miles Expiration: Flying Blue Is Stricter

Avios expire after 36 months of inactivity, while Flying Blue miles expire after 24 months. In both cases, any earning or spending activity resets the clock, so expiration is rarely an issue for active collectors. But if you're someone who goes through long periods without flying or using credit cards, the extra 12 months that Avios provides is a meaningful safety buffer.

Flying Blue's 24-month policy means you need to be slightly more intentional about keeping your balance active. The easiest way is to earn a few miles through a shopping portal transaction every year or two — it costs nothing and keeps your entire balance alive.

## So Which Should You Choose?

Here's my honest recommendation based on different travel profiles.

If you mostly fly within Europe — city breaks, short trips, visiting friends and family across the continent — focus on Flying Blue. The pricing is simply unbeatable for short-haul, and the Monthly Promo Rewards add extraordinary value. You'll get significantly more flights per mile than you would with Avios on these routes.

If you're targeting long-haul premium cabins — business class to Asia, first class to Africa, or anything involving Qatar, Cathay, or Japan Airlines — focus on Avios. The Oneworld partner network for premium cabin redemptions is broader and the products are generally better than what SkyTeam offers.

If you fly transatlantic regularly, it genuinely depends on your preferred routing. Amsterdam or Paris to the US? Flying Blue, especially with Promo Rewards. London or Dublin to the US? Avios, especially using the Aer Lingus route.

If you're a generalist who wants maximum flexibility — and this is the category most serious points collectors fall into — collect both. Use a flexible points credit card like the Amex Gold or Chase card, accumulate transferable points, and move them to whichever programme offers the best deal for each specific booking. This is the strategy that extracts the most value over time, because you're never locked into one programme's limitations.

## The Strategy I'd Recommend

The ideal setup for a European-based traveller looks something like this: earn flexible credit card points that transfer to both programmes. Check Flying Blue's Promo Rewards at the start of every month for cheap European flights and discounted long-haul deals. Use Avios for premium cabin partner bookings and the specific sweet spots where Oneworld excels. Keep a small balance in both programmes to prevent expiration, and transfer the bulk of your points only when you have a specific booking in mind.

The travellers who get the most value from the miles game aren't the ones who pick a single programme and stick with it dogmatically. They're the ones who understand the strengths of each currency and deploy them strategically. Avios and Flying Blue aren't competitors in your wallet — they're complementary tools, and using both well is how you turn credit card points into genuinely life-changing travel experiences.`,
