    title: "The Cheapest Way to Get Avios Points in 2026: Every Option Compared",
    excerpt: "From Balance Boost at under 1p per Avios to direct purchases at 2.45p — we break down every method to top up your Avios balance and what each one actually costs.",
    content: `If you need Avios for an award booking, the worst thing you can do is panic-buy at full price from ba.com. The difference between the cheapest and most expensive method is staggering — we're talking 0.92p versus 2.45p per Avios. That's nearly three times the cost for the same points.

Here's every method available in 2026, ranked from cheapest to most expensive, with honest pros and cons for each.

## 1. Avios Balance Boost — From 0.92p per Avios

![British Airways — the home of Avios points](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584084807193-bed442df7a75?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

This is the cheapest standard option for most people. Balance Boost lets you purchase a lump sum of Avios equal to 100%, 200%, or 300% of the Avios you've earned in the last 30 days.

If you earned 10,000 Avios from a flight or credit card spend last month, you can boost your balance by up to 30,000 additional Avios at 0.92p each. That's £276 for 30,000 Avios — hard to beat.

**The catch:** You need recent earning activity. If you haven't earned Avios in the last 30 days, this option won't appear. There's also a 300,000 Avios annual cap, after which the price jumps to 1.77p.

**Best for:** Topping up after a credit card bonus or flight. Plan your earning activity ahead of a big booking.

## 2. Avios Subscription — From 0.99p per Avios

A newer option that works like a monthly direct debit. You commit to a plan and receive Avios in monthly instalments. Four tiers are available, from 20,000 to 200,000 Avios per year.

Annual payment gets you roughly two months free compared to monthly billing, bringing the effective cost down to about 0.99p per Avios on the larger plans.

**The catch:** Avios arrive monthly, not as a lump sum. If you need 50,000 Avios next week for a booking, this won't help. It's a long game.

**Best for:** People who know they'll redeem regularly and want to build a balance over time.

## 3. Credit Card Sign-Up Bonuses — Effective Cost Under 1p

![Credit card rewards are the fastest way to earn Avios](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556742049-0cfed4f6a45d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

The BA American Express cards offer 25,000+ Avios as welcome bonuses. The Amex Preferred Rewards Gold earns Membership Rewards points that transfer 1:1 to Avios, with a 20,000-point sign-up bonus.

If you factor in the annual fee against the bonus, the effective cost per Avios often works out under 1p — sometimes as low as 0.5p if you'd be spending the money anyway.

**The catch:** Requires a credit application, minimum spend targets (typically £3,000–5,000 in three months), and annual fees (£195–450). Not instant gratification.

**Best for:** UK residents who can meet minimum spends. The single best long-term strategy for accumulating Avios.

## 4. Finnair Plus Promotions — From ~1.05p per Avios

Finnair runs regular promotions where you can purchase Avios through their Privilege Club. Since Finnair uses Avios as their currency, these points can be transferred to your British Airways account by linking the two programmes.

During the best promotions (like the 50% discount deals), prices drop to around 1.05p per Avios — exceptional value for a direct purchase.

**The catch:** Promotions are irregular. You need a Finnair Plus account, and transferring to BA requires linking accounts through the Avios system. Not complicated, but an extra step.

**Best for:** Opportunistic buyers who check regularly and jump on deals.

## 5. Qatar Airways Privilege Club — From ~1.75p per Avios

![Qatar Airways Q Suites — bookable with Avios](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684929167916-a844fcf314d7?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

Qatar Airways also uses Avios and runs periodic purchase promotions. Standard pricing starts around 1.75p, but bonus offers can bring this down significantly.

**The catch:** Promotions are less frequent than Finnair. Prices are usually in USD, so exchange rates matter for UK buyers.

**Best for:** When Qatar runs a strong promotion and other options aren't available.

## 6. Buy Directly from BA — 1.77p to 2.45p per Avios

The official ba.com purchase page is the most straightforward option but also the most expensive. Prices range from £49 for 2,000 Avios (2.45p each) down to £3,539 for 200,000 Avios (1.77p each).

**The catch:** Even the bulk rate of 1.77p is nearly double what you'd pay through Balance Boost. Only makes sense if no other option is available and you need Avios immediately.

**Best for:** Emergencies only. Check every other option first.

## 7. Use a Top-Up Service — Competitive Rates, Fast Delivery

Services like MilesTopUp transfer Avios directly to your account using credit card points transfer mechanisms. You request a quote, pay, and miles arrive within 24–48 hours.

The advantage is consistency: you get competitive rates without waiting for airline promotions, and there's no need for recent earning activity (unlike Balance Boost). It's particularly useful for larger top-ups where the convenience factor matters.

**Best for:** When you need a specific amount of Avios quickly, at a predictable price, without jumping through hoops.

## Which Method Should You Choose?

![Choosing the right method depends on your timeline](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1699810917663-2341cd65afee?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

It depends on your timeline and situation:

**If you have time (months):** Credit card bonuses + Balance Boost is the unbeatable combo. Earn Avios through spending, then boost at 0.92p.

**If you need Avios within weeks:** Check Finnair and Qatar for active promotions. If none are running, a top-up service gives you a reliable price.

**If you need Avios right now:** A top-up service (24–48 hours) or direct BA purchase (instant) are your options. The price difference between them can be significant, so always get a quote first.

**The golden rule:** Never buy Avios speculatively. Only top up when you have a specific booking in mind and know exactly how many points you need. Check the Avios plus cash combinations on ba.com too — sometimes paying a bit more cash and fewer Avios is the smarter play.`,

    title: "How to Get Flying Blue Miles in 2026: The Complete Guide",
    excerpt: "Everything you need to know about earning, buying, and maximising Flying Blue miles — from monthly Promo Rewards to transfer partners and sweet spot redemptions.",
    content: `Flying Blue is the loyalty programme of Air France and KLM, and it's arguably the best programme in Europe for award travel. Intra-European flights start at just 4,000 miles one-way, and the monthly Promo Rewards can slash prices by 25–50%.

But here's the thing: most people don't have enough miles when they find the perfect award seat. This guide covers every way to build your Flying Blue balance — fast.

## What Makes Flying Blue Special

![KLM — one of the two airlines behind Flying Blue](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1742429577899-369b2c19230d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

Before we get into earning methods, here's why Flying Blue is worth focusing on:

**Lowest intra-Europe awards:** 4,000–8,000 miles for a one-way economy flight within Europe. Try finding that in any other programme.

**Monthly Promo Rewards:** Every month, Air France and KLM release discounted award flights with 25–50% off the standard mileage cost. A business class flight from Amsterdam to New York that normally costs 70,000 miles might drop to 50,000 during a promo.

**SkyTeam access:** Your miles work on Air France, KLM, Delta, Korean Air, Vietnam Airlines, and more. That's global coverage.

**No expiration with activity:** As long as you earn or spend at least one mile every 24 months, your balance stays alive.

## Method 1: Transfer from Credit Card Programmes

![Transfer credit card points to Flying Blue for instant miles](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1646992914433-de93d0d06c98?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

The fastest way to build a large Flying Blue balance is through credit card points transfers. All major flexible points programmes transfer to Flying Blue at favourable ratios.

**1:1 Transfer Partners:**
- American Express Membership Rewards
- Chase Ultimate Rewards
- Citi ThankYou Rewards
- Capital One Miles
- Bilt Rewards

**Other Partners:**
- Marriott Bonvoy: 3:1 ratio (60,000 Bonvoy = 20,000 Flying Blue, plus a 5,000-mile bonus for transfers of 60,000+)

Transfers from Amex, Chase, and Citi are typically instant. This means you can search for an award flight, confirm availability, transfer the miles, and book — all within minutes.

**Pro tip:** Watch for transfer bonuses. Amex and Chase occasionally run 20–30% bonus promotions on transfers to Flying Blue. When these hit, it's time to move points.

## Method 2: Fly with SkyTeam Airlines

Every flight on Air France, KLM, or a SkyTeam partner earns Flying Blue miles based on your ticket price (not distance).

Base earning rates per euro spent on the ticket:
- Explorer (no status): 4 miles per euro
- Silver: 6 miles per euro
- Gold: 7 miles per euro
- Platinum: 8 miles per euro

A €500 round trip Paris–New York in economy earns 2,000 miles at the base level. Not huge, but it adds up — especially if you're a regular flyer on these routes.

## Method 3: Monthly Promo Rewards

![Air France business class — bookable at a discount during Promo Rewards](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1719405524195-c3a331daa84f?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

This is Flying Blue's killer feature. Around the first week of every month, Air France and KLM publish discounted award flights for that month.

**How they work:**
- Log in to your Flying Blue account
- Search award flights with the Promo Rewards filter
- Discounts range from 25% to 50% off standard prices
- Available in all cabins: economy, premium economy, business
- Must be booked by month-end
- Limited availability — book fast

**Recent examples:**
- February 2026: 25% off Europe to US routes (NYC, Boston to Amsterdam/Paris)
- Typical: 15,000 miles for intra-Europe business class (normally 20,000–30,000)

**Pro tip:** Set a calendar reminder for the 5th of every month. Check the promo page immediately. The best availability goes within days.

## Method 4: Hotel and Partner Earning

Flying Blue partners with hotels, car rentals, and shopping portals:

**Hotels:**
- Booking.com: 2 miles per euro spent, plus periodic 15–30% bonus promotions
- Hyatt partnership: 500 miles per qualifying stay

**Car Rentals:**
- Hertz: Up to 12 miles per euro on electric vehicles

**Shopping:**
- Air France/KLM shopping portals offer bonus miles at hundreds of retailers

These aren't going to fill your account quickly, but they're free miles on spending you'd do anyway.

## Method 5: Buy Miles or Use a Top-Up Service

Sometimes you find the perfect award seat but you're 10,000 or 20,000 miles short. Waiting to earn them through flying or credit cards means losing that seat.

**Buying direct from Air France/KLM:** Available but pricing varies. Typically 1.5–3 cents per mile depending on quantity and promotions. Check the Flying Blue website for current rates.

**Using a top-up service:** Services like MilesTopUp can add Flying Blue miles to your account within 24–48 hours at competitive rates. You get a personalised quote based on the quantity you need.

**When this makes sense:** Only when you have a specific booking in mind. Calculate the cost of the miles versus paying cash for the ticket. If you're getting more than 1.5 cents of value per mile on the redemption, topping up is a good deal.

## Method 6: Family Pooling

Flying Blue allows up to 8 accounts to pool miles together. This is a game-changer for families — combine everyone's earning into one pot and book faster.

Setting it up is free through the Flying Blue website. Each member still earns into their own account, but you can access the combined balance for bookings.

## Best Redemption Sweet Spots

![Flying Blue sweet spots include Paris and Amsterdam routes](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1679231926690-cb1e8abfcefd?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

Knowing where your miles go furthest helps you decide how many to accumulate:

**Intra-Europe:** 4,000–8,000 miles one-way in economy. Amsterdam to Rome, Paris to Barcelona — these are incredible values.

**Europe to North America:** 25,000–35,000 miles one-way in economy during Promo Rewards. Business class from 50,000 miles.

**Europe to Asia/Middle East:** 30,000–50,000 miles one-way in economy. Paris to Dubai, Amsterdam to Tokyo.

**Business class to the US:** The sweet spot. A lie-flat seat from Paris or Amsterdam to New York for 50,000–70,000 miles (35,000–50,000 during promos) is outstanding value when the cash fare is often €2,000+.

## Flying Blue vs Other Programmes for Europe

How does Flying Blue stack up for European travel?

**Flying Blue:** 4,000–8,000 miles intra-Europe. Monthly promos. SkyTeam network.

**British Airways (Avios):** Starts around 6,000 Avios for short-haul, but fuel surcharges on BA flights are brutal. Avios are better for Oneworld partners like Qatar Airways.

**Virgin Atlantic:** 10,000 miles minimum for intra-Europe. Less competitive on short-haul.

**Verdict:** For intra-Europe and Air France/KLM routes, Flying Blue wins. For long-haul premium cabins on Qatar or Cathay Pacific, Avios might be better. Ideally, you want both.

## The Strategy

Here's the playbook for building a useful Flying Blue balance:

1. **Get a flexible points credit card** (Amex, Chase) and earn on everyday spending
2. **Watch for transfer bonuses** — move points to Flying Blue during 20–30% promotions
3. **Check Promo Rewards monthly** — set a calendar reminder
4. **Use family pooling** if you have a partner or family who also fly
5. **Top up when needed** — don't lose a great award seat because you're 10k miles short
6. **Stack earning:** shopping portals + hotels + flights + credit cards

The goal isn't to hoard miles forever. It's to have enough when that perfect award seat appears — and to book it before someone else does.`,

    title: "What Are Avios? The Complete Beginner's Guide for 2026",
    excerpt: "Avios are the loyalty currency used by British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, Qatar Airways and more. Here's everything you need to know — what they're worth, how to earn them, and how to use them.",
    content: `You've probably heard people talk about Avios — maybe a colleague mentioned flying business class "for free," or you noticed the word on your British Airways booking. But what actually are Avios, and why do so many travellers obsess over them?

This guide explains everything from scratch. No jargon, no assumptions. By the end, you'll understand exactly what Avios are worth, how the system works, and whether collecting them makes sense for you.

## What Are Avios, Exactly?

![British Airways — the biggest airline in the Avios family](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589891459986-e4067c86c351?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

Avios are a travel loyalty currency. Think of them like air miles, but shared across multiple airlines and programmes. One Avios point is the same whether you earn it with British Airways in London, Iberia in Madrid, or Qatar Airways in Doha.

The name "Avios" replaced the old British Airways Miles in 2011 when BA merged its loyalty currency with Iberia's. Today, Avios is the common currency across the entire Avios Group.

**Airlines that use Avios:**
- **British Airways** Executive Club
- **Iberia** Plus
- **Aer Lingus** AerClub
- **Vueling** Club
- **Qatar Airways** Privilege Club
- **Finnair** Plus (recently joined)

This is important because it means you can earn Avios with one airline and spend them with another. Earned Avios flying Iberia from Madrid? You can use them to book a British Airways flight from London. Earned them with a UK credit card? You can spend them on a Qatar Airways Q Suite from Doha.

## How Much Is One Avios Worth?

This is the question everyone asks, and the honest answer is: it depends on how you use them.

**The general rule:** One Avios is worth between 0.5p and 1.5p, depending on the redemption. Some premium bookings push the value even higher.

**Here's what that looks like in practice:**

A short-haul economy flight from London to Dublin might cost 13,000 Avios + £1 in taxes. If the cash fare is £80, you're getting about 0.6p per Avios — decent but not spectacular.

A business class flight from London to New York might cost 60,000 Avios + £600 in taxes and surcharges. If the cash fare is £2,500, you're getting about 3.2p per Avios — exceptional value.

**The lesson:** Avios are worth more when you use them for expensive flights, especially long-haul premium cabins. Using them for cheap short-haul flights gives you less value per point.

## How Do You Earn Avios?

There are dozens of ways to earn Avios. Here are the main ones, roughly ordered by how many points you can accumulate:

**1. Credit Card Spending**

This is how most people build large Avios balances. The British Airways American Express cards earn Avios directly on every purchase. The Amex Preferred Rewards Gold earns Membership Rewards points that transfer 1:1 to Avios.

Typical earning rates: 1–1.5 Avios per £1 spent, plus sign-up bonuses of 25,000+ Avios.

If you spend £2,000 a month on a BA Amex, that's roughly 24,000 Avios per year just from everyday spending — before any bonuses.

**2. Flying**

![Every flight earns Avios based on distance and cabin class](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541938341575-d7fd71601ddd?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

Every flight on BA, Iberia, Aer Lingus, or any Oneworld partner airline earns Avios. The amount depends on the route distance, booking class, and your Executive Club status.

A London to New York economy flight earns around 4,500 Avios. The same route in business class earns around 9,000 Avios. First class: up to 18,000 Avios.

You also earn Avios on partner airlines like American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, and Qantas — as long as you credit the flight to your Executive Club account.

**3. Shopping Portals and Partners**

The BA Shopping portal gives you bonus Avios when you shop at hundreds of online retailers. Rates vary from 2 to 15 Avios per £1 spent, on top of your credit card earnings.

Other earning partners include:
- Hotels (Marriott Bonvoy, Hyatt)
- Car rentals (Avis, Hertz)
- Dining programmes
- Nectar (Sainsbury's loyalty card transfers to Avios at 400 Nectar = 250 Avios)

**4. Purchasing or Topping Up**

Sometimes you're close to having enough Avios for a booking but need a few thousand more. You can purchase Avios directly from BA (expensive), use Balance Boost (cheaper), or use a top-up service like MilesTopUp for competitive rates with fast delivery.

We covered every purchase method in detail in our guide: The Cheapest Way to Get Avios in 2026.

## How Do You Spend Avios?

This is where it gets exciting. Avios can be used for:

**Flights (the main event)**

You can book reward flights on British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, and any Oneworld partner airline. The cost depends on the route distance and cabin class.

![Business class — where Avios deliver the best value](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1768346564210-f382cdf18375?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

**Sample Avios costs (one-way):**
- London to Dublin, economy: 13,000 Avios
- London to Paris, economy: 9,500 Avios
- London to New York, economy: 26,000 Avios
- London to New York, business: 60,000 Avios
- London to Tokyo, business: 84,000 Avios
- London to Cape Town, first class: 102,000 Avios

**Important:** On top of Avios, you also pay taxes, fees, and fuel surcharges. On British Airways flights, surcharges can be significant — sometimes £400+ on a long-haul return. This is BA's biggest drawback. Other airlines in the Avios family (like Iberia and Aer Lingus) charge much lower surcharges for the same routes.

**Pro tip:** Book through Iberia or Aer Lingus instead of BA for the same Oneworld flights with lower surcharges. A London to New York flight booked through Iberia's Avios system costs the same Avios but can save you hundreds in fees.

**Upgrades**

If you've bought a cash ticket, you can sometimes use Avios to upgrade to the next cabin. The availability is limited, but when it works, it's great value.

**Hotels**

Avios can be redeemed for hotel stays through the BA Executive Club portal. The value is generally poor compared to flights — you'll get more bang for your buck using Avios for flying.

**Part-Pay with Avios**

BA lets you combine Avios and cash on the same booking. This is useful when you don't have quite enough Avios for a full reward flight. You can slide a bar on ba.com to choose how much you pay in Avios versus cash.

The effective value of Avios in part-pay varies, so check the maths before committing. Sometimes it's better to pay full cash and save your Avios for a pure reward booking.

## The Avios Sweet Spots You Should Know

Not all Avios redemptions are equal. Here are the bookings where insiders get the best value:

**1. Off-Peak Short-Haul**

BA has peak and off-peak pricing. An off-peak economy flight within Europe can cost as little as 9,500 Avios — excellent value when the cash fare is £100+.

**2. Partner Airlines with Low Surcharges**

Using Avios on airlines like Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, or Qatar Airways means you pay minimal surcharges. A Cathay Pacific business class flight from Hong Kong to London costs 75,000 Avios with under £50 in taxes. The same routing on BA metal would add £400+ in surcharges.

**3. Qatar Airways Q Suites**

Widely considered the best business class in the world. Bookable with Avios through the BA or Qatar websites. Doha to many destinations in business class costs 42,500–75,000 Avios with low surcharges.

**4. Aer Lingus Transatlantic**

Dublin to US cities in business class for 50,000 Avios with minimal surcharges. If you can position to Dublin, this is one of the best Avios redemptions available.

## Do Avios Expire?

Avios expire after **36 months of inactivity**. That means if you don't earn or spend a single Avios for three years, your balance is wiped.

The good news: almost any activity resets the clock. A single credit card transaction that earns Avios, a small purchase through the shopping portal, or even transferring one Avios point between household accounts keeps your balance alive for another 36 months.

**Tip:** Set a calendar reminder for every 30 months. If you haven't had any Avios activity, do something small to reset the timer.

## Avios vs Other Loyalty Currencies

How do Avios compare to the competition?

![Choosing the right loyalty programme depends on where you fly](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1567616995076-21d5f1049c7c?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&q=80&w=1080)

**Avios vs Flying Blue (Air France/KLM):** Flying Blue is better for intra-Europe flights (4,000 miles vs 9,500 Avios). Avios are better for long-haul premium cabins, especially on Qatar and Cathay Pacific. Ideally, collect both.

**Avios vs Virgin Atlantic Points:** Virgin is excellent for specific routes (especially Upper Class to the US), but Avios offer far more flexibility with the Oneworld alliance. Virgin is limited to Delta and a few partners.

**Avios vs Lufthansa Miles & More:** Miles & More has famously poor redemption rates and high surcharges. Avios win in almost every comparison.

**Verdict:** Avios are arguably the most versatile loyalty currency for UK-based travellers. The combination of BA's network, Oneworld partners, and the ability to use them across six different airlines makes them hard to beat.

## Is Collecting Avios Worth It?

Yes — if you have a plan. Randomly collecting Avios with no redemption goal in mind means your points sit there losing value to inflation and programme devaluations.

**Avios make sense if you:**
- Fly from the UK or Europe regularly
- Have a credit card that earns transferable points
- Are willing to be flexible with travel dates
- Want to fly business or first class without paying cash fares

**Avios might not be for you if you:**
- Only fly once a year domestically
- Prefer to always book the cheapest cash fare regardless of airline
- Don't want to spend time learning the system

The sweet spot is using Avios for flights you couldn't justify paying cash for. A business class seat to New York that costs £2,500? Hard to justify. The same seat for 60,000 Avios that you earned from credit card spending? That changes the maths entirely.

## Getting Started: Your First Steps

1. **Join the BA Executive Club** — it's free. Sign up at ba.com.
2. **Get an Avios-earning credit card** — the BA Amex or Amex Preferred Rewards Gold are the best starting points in the UK.
3. **Link your accounts** — connect your BA, Iberia, and Aer Lingus accounts so you can use Avios across all three.
4. **Set a goal** — decide where you want to fly and how many Avios you need. Work backwards from there.
5. **Start earning** — use your credit card for everyday spending, shop through the BA portal, and credit all Oneworld flights to your account.

Building a useful Avios balance takes time — typically 6–12 months of focused earning. But when you're sipping champagne in business class on a flight you "paid" for with grocery shopping points, it all feels very much worth it.`,
