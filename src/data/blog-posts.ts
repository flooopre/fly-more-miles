    title: "Flying Blue Miles: The Complete Redemption Guide (2026)",
    excerpt: "Everything you need to know about Flying Blue in 2026—from booking Air France La Première to finding monthly promo awards. The complete guide to maximising your Flying Blue redemptions.",
    content: `Flying Blue is the frequent flyer program shared by Air France and KLM, and if you know how to use it properly, it's one of the most valuable mileage currencies in the game. With access to the entire SkyTeam alliance, monthly promo awards that can save you 25-50% on redemptions, and the ability to book some of the world's best business and first class products for reasonable mileage costs, Flying Blue deserves serious attention from anyone who redeems points for premium travel.

The program gets less hype than British Airways Avios or American AAdvantage, which means a lot of people overlook it entirely. That's a mistake. Flying Blue has quirks you need to understand—particularly around dynamic pricing—but once you learn the system, you'll consistently find exceptional value that simply doesn't exist elsewhere.

This is your complete guide to Flying Blue miles in 2026. We'll cover how pricing works, the best redemptions for business and first class, sweet spots most people miss, how to find award availability, monthly promo awards, transfer partners, and the common mistakes that waste miles. By the end, you'll know exactly when to use Flying Blue and when to look elsewhere.

## How Flying Blue Award Pricing Actually Works

Unlike programs like British Airways Avios that use predictable distance-based charts, Flying Blue uses dynamic pricing for most routes. If you're used to knowing exactly how many miles a specific route costs regardless of when you fly, Flying Blue will feel different—and that difference matters.

**Dynamic pricing means the cost fluctuates based on:**

- Demand for that specific flight
- Time until departure
- Route popularity
- Season and holidays
- How many award seats have already been booked

Here's a concrete example. Paris to New York in business class might cost 53,000 miles on a random Tuesday in February when demand is soft. That same route on a Friday evening before Christmas? You're looking at 110,000+ miles for the exact same seat on the exact same aircraft. That's more than double.

The upside of dynamic pricing is that if you're flexible with dates and willing to search, you can find genuinely spectacular deals—sometimes 30-40% cheaper than the "standard" award chart would suggest. The downside is unpredictability. You can't just assume a route will cost X miles because you read that somewhere online six months ago.

### Where Flying Blue Still Uses Semi-Predictable Pricing

While most long-haul routes are fully dynamic, some categories of flights still show fairly consistent pricing patterns:

**Air France and KLM operated flights within Europe:**
- Business class: Typically 20,000-35,000 miles one-way
- Economy: Usually 10,000-18,000 miles one-way

These short-haul redemptions are among the best uses of Flying Blue miles if you're based in Europe or frequently travel within the continent. Compared to what British Airways charges in Avios for similar routes—often with hefty fuel surcharges on top—Flying Blue's intra-Europe awards are excellent value.

**Medium-haul routes (Europe to North Africa, Middle East, etc.):**
- Business: Around 30,000-50,000 miles
- Economy: Roughly 15,000-25,000 miles

**Long-haul transatlantic and transpacific:**

This is where dynamic pricing dominates completely. Business class awards range from 53,000 miles at the low end to 120,000+ at peak times. First class on Air France can swing from around 100,000 to 180,000+ depending on demand. There's no chart to memorise—you just search and see what the system quotes.

The key insight here is that **flexibility is your most valuable asset** when using Flying Blue. If you can shift your travel dates by even 2-3 days, you might cut your mileage cost by 30-50%. That's worth planning around if you're booking far in advance and your schedule allows it.

## The Best Flying Blue Redemptions for Premium Cabins

Let's get into the specific redemptions where Flying Blue delivers exceptional value—the bookings that make accumulating these miles worthwhile.

### 1. Air France La Première (First Class)

![Air France's La Première — one of the world's finest first class products.](/images/blog/airfrance-business-777.jpg)

Air France's La Première is consistently ranked among the top three first class products in the world, and in 2025 they unveiled an entirely redesigned suite that raises the bar even higher. This isn't just a seat—it's a multi-compartment private cabin that genuinely feels like flying in a boutique hotel room.

**What makes La Première special:**

- A full suite with five windows (unheard of in commercial aviation)
- Chaise longue seating that converts to a completely flat bed
- Separate wardrobe and vanity area
- Hermès amenity kits and bedding
- Michelin-starred dining designed specifically for altitude
- Caviar service and French champagne on departure
- Ultra-exclusive with only 4 suites per aircraft

The experience is genuinely world-class. If you've flown Emirates First or Singapore Suites and wondered what else is out there at that level, this is it. Air France doesn't compromise on service, food quality, or privacy.

**Where you can fly La Première:**

Air France operates La Première on select long-haul routes from Paris Charles de Gaulle:

- Paris (CDG) ↔ New York (JFK)
- Paris (CDG) ↔ Los Angeles (LAX)
- Paris (CDG) ↔ Washington Dulles (IAD)
- Paris (CDG) ↔ São Paulo (GRU)
- Paris (CDG) ↔ Dubai (DXB)
- Paris (CDG) ↔ Singapore (SIN)

Not every flight has La Première—it's limited to specific aircraft (mostly 777-300ERs with the new product). You need to check the specific flight and aircraft type when searching.

**Award pricing for La Première:**

Expect to pay between 100,000 and 180,000 Flying Blue miles one-way depending on demand and route. The best value tends to be on routes like Paris to São Paulo where demand is softer—you might find space around 110,000-130,000 miles. Peak summer transatlantic routes to New York can push 160,000-180,000 miles.

Those numbers might sound high, but context matters. Paid La Première tickets routinely sell for £8,000-12,000 one-way. You're getting access to one of the world's finest first class products for 100,000-180,000 miles that you can transfer instantly from Amex, Chase, or Citi. The value is absolutely there.

**How to find La Première award space:**

Search directly on airfrance.com after logging into your Flying Blue account. Award space is extremely limited—there are only 4 suites per plane, and Air France releases maybe 1-2 award seats per flight at most. Book as far out as the calendar allows (330 days) for your best shot at finding space. If you're flexible on dates, try searching multiple days around your target travel window.

### 2. KLM Business Class on Long-Haul Routes

![KLM's World Business Class on the 787 Dreamliner — excellent award availability.](/images/blog/klm-787-schiphol-2024.jpg)

KLM doesn't get the same attention as some flashier carriers, but their long-haul business class product is genuinely excellent and—critically—they release far more award space than Air France does. If you want a premium cabin redemption that you can actually book without waiting months for space to open up, KLM business is your answer.

**The KLM business class product:**

- Fully flat beds in a reverse herringbone configuration
- Direct aisle access from every seat (no climbing over anyone)
- Modern IFE with large screens
- Excellent Dutch catering and attentive service
- The signature fresh tulips on your meal tray (a nice touch)

It's not revolutionary, but it's very well executed. The seats are comfortable, the service is professional without being stuffy, and you'll sleep well on overnight flights. This is exactly what business class should be—functional, comfortable, and reliable.

**Best routes for KLM business awards:**

**From Amsterdam to North America:**
- AMS → New York (JFK/EWR): 60,000-85,000 miles
- AMS → Los Angeles (LAX): 70,000-95,000 miles
- AMS → San Francisco (SFO): 70,000-90,000 miles
- AMS → Boston (BOS): 60,000-80,000 miles

**From Amsterdam to Asia:**
- AMS → Singapore (SIN): 75,000-100,000 miles
- AMS → Tokyo (NRT): 80,000-105,000 miles
- AMS → Bangkok (BKK): 70,000-95,000 miles

The beauty of KLM is consistency. While Air France's award space can be sparse and unpredictable, KLM releases business class seats far more generously. If you're flexible with dates and search 3-6 months out, you'll consistently find saver-level space in the 60,000-75,000 mile range for transatlantic flights.

**Pro tip on KLM fifth freedom routes:**

KLM operates some fifth freedom routes—flights between two foreign countries—and these sometimes have exceptional award availability. Routes like Buenos Aires to Santiago or Guayaquil to Bonaire can have wide-open business class space at attractive prices. If you're travelling in South America or the Caribbean, it's worth searching KLM's network creatively to see what turns up.

### 3. Delta One Suites Booked with Flying Blue Miles

Here's something most people don't realise: You can book Delta flights using Flying Blue miles, and the pricing is often dramatically better than using Delta's own SkyMiles program.

Delta is notoriously stingy with its own award pricing, often charging 200,000-300,000+ SkyMiles for premium cabin flights that competitors price at half that cost. But because Delta is a SkyTeam partner, Flying Blue can book the same Delta flights at significantly more reasonable rates.

**Example that illustrates the value:**

Los Angeles to Sydney in Delta One Suites:
- Using Delta SkyMiles: 220,000+ miles one-way
- Using Flying Blue: 95,000-130,000 miles one-way

That's nearly half the cost for the exact same seat on the exact same flight. This pricing disparity exists across Delta's long-haul network, particularly on transpacific routes.

**Where this strategy works best:**

- Transpacific routes (U.S. West Coast to Australia, Asia)
- Premium transcontinental U.S. routes (JFK-LAX in Delta One)
- Select transatlantic routes to Europe

The catch—and it's a significant one—is that Delta doesn't release much premium cabin award space to partner programs. You'll find it, but you need to be patient and flexible. If you have specific dates and can't move them, don't count on Delta space being available through Flying Blue.

### 4. Virgin Atlantic Upper Class (Hidden Gem)

Most people don't know this: Flying Blue can book Virgin Atlantic Upper Class on certain routes, and the pricing is often better than using Virgin's own program.

Virgin's Upper Class product is excellent, especially on their A350s:
- The Loft social space at the front of the cabin
- Fully flat herringbone seats
- Premium bedding and amenities
- Access to Virgin's outstanding Clubhouse lounges at Heathrow

**Typical award pricing for Virgin via Flying Blue:**

- London to U.S. East Coast: 60,000-80,000 miles
- London to California: 80,000-100,000 miles
- London to Caribbean: 65,000-85,000 miles

This is a genuinely underused sweet spot because most people don't even think to check Virgin availability when searching Flying Blue. But if you're flying between London and North America or the Caribbean, it's absolutely worth looking.

### 5. Short-Haul Business Class Within Europe

If you're based in Europe or travelling within the continent, Flying Blue's intra-Europe business class redemptions are among the best value propositions in the entire program.

Yes, European business class is just economy seats with the middle seat blocked and slightly better catering. But you also get:
- Priority check-in and boarding
- Lounge access (often excellent at hubs like Amsterdam and Paris CDG)
- Better onboard service and meals
- Flexibility with changes and cancellations

**Typical pricing for European business awards:**

- Amsterdam or Paris to anywhere in Europe: 12,000-25,000 miles one-way
- Amsterdam to Barcelona: ~15,000 miles
- Paris to Rome: ~18,000 miles
- Amsterdam to Athens: ~20,000 miles
- Paris to London: ~12,000 miles

For frequent European travellers, these short-haul redemptions add up to serious value over time. If you're flying multiple European routes in a year, using Flying Blue miles instead of cash fares can save hundreds of euros while upgrading your travel experience.

## Monthly Promo Awards: The Secret Weapon

This is where Flying Blue truly differentiates itself from every other program. Every month, they release a list of 50-100 routes with discounted award pricing—typically 25% to 50% off the standard cost.

**How Promo Awards work:**

- On the 1st of each month, Flying Blue publishes that month's Promo Rewards list
- Discounts apply to specific routes (both directions)
- You can book these awards anytime during that calendar month
- Travel dates can be 1-12 months into the future
- Once the month ends, those specific promos disappear (but new ones replace them)

**Example hypothetical February 2026 promos:**

- Paris → Tokyo: Normally 70,000 miles → **52,500 miles with 25% discount**
- Amsterdam → Nairobi: Normally 55,000 miles → **41,250 miles with 25% discount**
- Paris → New York: Normally 85,000 miles → **63,750 miles with 25% discount**

These aren't theoretical savings—this is how the program actually operates every single month. If you're planning travel 3-9 months out and you have flexibility on exact dates, checking the monthly Promo Rewards before booking is absolutely essential. You might save 15,000-30,000 miles just by timing your booking to coincide with a relevant promo.

**Where to find Promo Awards:**

Log into Flying Blue on airfrance.com or klm.com and navigate to the "Promo Rewards" section. You can filter by departure city, destination region, and cabin class to see what's currently available.

**Pro strategy:**

If you're planning a trip 4-6 months out but not in a rush to book immediately, wait for the first of the next month and check whether your route appears in the Promo Rewards. If it does, book then and save 25-50%. If it doesn't, you can still book at standard pricing—you haven't lost anything by waiting a few days.

## How to Actually Find Flying Blue Award Availability

Searching for award space can be frustrating if you don't know the right tools. Here's how to do it efficiently.

### 1. Search Directly on Air France or KLM Websites

The official method is logging into airfrance.com or klm.com and searching with the "Pay with Miles" option selected. This shows you exactly what award space exists and what it costs.

**Pros:**
- Most accurate real-time availability
- Shows exact mileage pricing including any promos
- Allows mixed cabin bookings (business out, economy back)

**Cons:**
- The search interface is clunky and slow
- Calendar view only shows +/- 3 days around your search date
- Partner airline space isn't always displayed clearly

### 2. Use AwardFares (Paid Tool)

AwardFares is hands-down the best third-party tool for searching Flying Blue award space across the entire SkyTeam network.

**What AwardFares does well:**

- Calendar view showing pricing across 30+ days at once
- Set up alerts for specific routes when space opens
- Filter by aircraft type, specific airlines, seat configuration
- Covers all SkyTeam partners comprehensively

The tool costs around €10-15 per month depending on your subscription level, which is absolutely worth it if you're actively searching for premium cabin awards and want to find the best possible pricing without manually checking dozens of date combinations.

### 3. Google Flights + Manual Verification

Here's a free hack that works surprisingly well:

1. Use Google Flights to search your route and find flights you want (times, dates, connections)
2. Note the specific flight numbers and times
3. Go to airfrance.com and search those exact flights with "Pay with Miles" enabled

This lets you leverage Google's superior UX and comprehensive search while still verifying actual award availability and pricing through the official Flying Blue booking engine. It's a bit tedious for complex multi-city searches, but for simple round-trips it saves significant time.

## Transfer Partners: How to Earn Flying Blue Miles

The fastest way to build a Flying Blue balance is transferring points from credit card programs. All major transferable points currencies partner with Flying Blue, and transfers are typically instant.

**Flying Blue transfer partners (1:1 ratio unless noted):**

- **American Express Membership Rewards** — Instant transfer
- **Chase Ultimate Rewards** — Instant transfer
- **Citi ThankYou Points** — Instant transfer
- **Capital One Miles** — Instant transfer
- **Bilt Rewards** — Instant transfer (frequent 50-100% bonuses!)

All of these transfer at 1:1, meaning 50,000 credit card points becomes 50,000 Flying Blue miles. Transfers are processed immediately in almost all cases—you initiate the transfer and within minutes the miles appear in your Flying Blue account.

**Which credit cards to focus on for Flying Blue accumulation:**

If you're specifically targeting Flying Blue redemptions, these cards give you the most strategic value:

1. **American Express Platinum or Gold** — MR points transfer instantly and Amex frequently runs 25-40% transfer bonuses to Flying Blue
2. **Chase Sapphire Reserve or Sapphire Preferred** — UR points are incredibly flexible and transfer to Flying Blue at 1:1
3. **Bilt Mastercard** — Earn points on rent payments (huge earning potential) and Bilt consistently offers 50-100% transfer bonuses to Flying Blue multiple times per year

**Transfer bonus strategy:**

Flying Blue periodically runs transfer bonuses where you get 25-50% extra miles when transferring from specific partners. These promotions are sporadic and unpredictable, but they're announced via email and on FlyerTalk forums.

The smart approach is to find your award flight first, confirm space is available, then transfer the exact number of points you need. Don't speculatively transfer hoping for future value unless there's an active bonus promotion running and you have specific redemptions planned.

## When to Use Flying Blue vs Other Programs

You've got options when it comes to redeeming points for flights. Here's when Flying Blue is the right choice and when to look elsewhere.

**Use Flying Blue when:**

✅ You're booking Air France, KLM, or their operated flights (best availability and pricing)
✅ You want access to monthly Promo Awards (can save 25-50%)
✅ Delta is pricing its own awards absurdly high via SkyMiles
✅ You're flexible with travel dates (dynamic pricing rewards flexibility)
✅ You're booking short-haul European flights (excellent value)

**Use British Airways Avios instead when:**

✅ You're booking very short-haul flights where distance-based pricing wins
✅ You want completely predictable, chart-based award costs
✅ You're booking on Iberia or Aer Lingus (often better Avios availability)

**Use Delta SkyMiles when:**

✅ Honestly? Almost never. Delta's own pricing is usually terrible compared to booking the same flights through Flying Blue.

**Use other SkyTeam programs (e.g., Virgin Atlantic) when:**

✅ Flying Blue shows no availability but Virgin Atlantic or another partner does
✅ Specific transfer bonuses make another program temporarily cheaper

The key is always searching multiple programs before committing. Just because Flying Blue usually offers good value doesn't mean it's optimal for every single redemption.

## What to Expect for Taxes and Fees

Unlike British Airways Avios—which infamously tacks on £300-600 in fuel surcharges for long-haul redemptions—Flying Blue keeps cash costs relatively low.

**Typical out-of-pocket fees on Flying Blue awards:**

- **Air France/KLM operated flights:** £50-150 (mostly airport taxes and security fees)
- **Delta operated flights:** $5.60 (literally just the U.S. security fee)
- **Virgin Atlantic operated:** £200-400 (higher due to UK Air Passenger Duty)

This is a genuinely underrated aspect of Flying Blue. Even when you're booking a business class ticket that would cost £4,000-6,000 in cash, you're only paying £50-150 in fees on top of your miles. Compare that to Avios where you might pay £400-600 in surcharges on the same route, and Flying Blue's value proposition becomes even clearer.

The only exception is Virgin Atlantic, where UK departure taxes push fees higher. But even then, you're looking at £200-300 rather than £600+, so it's still reasonable.

## Mistakes That Waste Flying Blue Miles

Let's talk about what not to do—the common errors that cost people thousands of miles unnecessarily.

**Mistake #1: Booking too close to departure**

Flying Blue uses dynamic pricing that gets progressively worse as flights fill up and departure approaches. Booking 1-2 weeks out might cost you 80,000-100,000 miles for a business class seat that would have been 55,000-65,000 miles if you'd booked 3-4 months earlier.

Book your awards as far in advance as possible—ideally 3-6 months out when pricing is most favourable and availability is widest.

**Mistake #2: Not checking monthly Promo Awards first**

If you book on February 28th without checking whether your route is a March promo, you might pay 85,000 miles for an award that will cost 63,750 miles if you wait 3 days. Always check the current month's promos and—if you're booking close to the month boundary—peek at next month's list too.

**Mistake #3: Assuming all SkyTeam partners are bookable**

Flying Blue theoretically has access to the entire SkyTeam alliance, but in practice, some partners release very little (or zero) award space. Airlines like Aeromexico, Saudia, and China Eastern show sparse availability at best.

Stick to Air France, KLM, Delta, Virgin Atlantic, and Kenya Airways for the most consistent partner space.

**Mistake #4: Transferring points before confirming award space**

Award seats can vanish in seconds—someone else books them, the airline pulls them, the system glitches. Find your flight, confirm the exact date/flight number/price, screenshot it for reference, THEN transfer your points.

Since transfers from Amex/Chase/Citi are instant, there's zero reason to transfer speculatively and risk the space disappearing while your miles sit unused in your Flying Blue account.

**Mistake #5: Ignoring mixed-cabin options**

Flying Blue lets you book outbound business and return economy (or vice versa) on a single award ticket. If you only care about sleeping on the overnight flight but don't mind economy on the daytime return, booking mixed cabins can save you 30,000-40,000 miles compared to round-trip business.

Check both directions separately and see if one direction offers better value or availability than booking business both ways.

## Final Verdict: Is Flying Blue Worth Accumulating?

Absolutely—if you're targeting premium cabin travel and you're willing to be flexible with dates.

Flying Blue's dynamic pricing can be frustrating if you want the predictability of fixed award charts. But if you approach it strategically—booking far in advance, checking monthly promos, being flexible with travel dates—you'll consistently find exceptional value that simply doesn't exist in other programs.

The ability to book Air France La Première, the monthly 25-50% discount promos, the option to book Delta flights for half what Delta charges, and the low cash fees all add up to a program that punches well above its weight.

**Bottom line strategy:**

Keep flexible credit card points (Amex MR, Chase UR, Citi TYP) and transfer to Flying Blue when you find a compelling redemption. Don't speculatively transfer unless there's an active bonus running and you have specific bookings planned.

And when you do spot that perfect award—whether it's La Première to Paris or KLM business to Singapore—pull the trigger quickly. Award space doesn't wait around.`,

    title: "The Cheapest Way to Get Avios Points in 2026: Every Option Compared",
    excerpt: "From Balance Boost at under 1p per Avios to direct purchases at 2.45p — we break down every method to top up your Avios balance and what each one actually costs.",
    content: `If you need Avios for an award booking, the worst thing you can do is panic-buy at full price from ba.com. The price difference between the cheapest and most expensive method of topping up your Avios balance is genuinely staggering — we're talking 0.92p versus 2.45p per Avios, which means you could be paying nearly three times more for the exact same points simply by choosing the wrong option.

The good news is that there are several ways to get Avios at a reasonable price, and some of them are remarkably cheap if you know where to look. I've ranked every method available in 2026 from cheapest to most expensive, with an honest assessment of who each option actually works for.

## 1. Avios Balance Boost — From 0.92p per Avios

![British Airways A350-1000 — the home of Avios points](/images/blog/ba-a350-heathrow-2025.jpg)

Balance Boost is the cheapest standard way to get Avios for most people, and it's a feature that doesn't get nearly enough attention. The way it works is straightforward: BA allows you to purchase additional Avios equal to 100%, 200%, or 300% of the Avios you've earned in the previous 30 days. So if you earned 10,000 Avios from a flight or credit card spend last month, you can boost your balance by up to 30,000 additional Avios at just 0.92p each. That works out to £276 for 30,000 Avios — genuinely hard to beat anywhere.

The catch is that you need recent earning activity for the option to appear. If you haven't earned any Avios in the last 30 days, Balance Boost simply won't show up in your account. There's also an annual cap of 300,000 Avios at this price point, after which the rate jumps to 1.77p. The smart play is to plan your earning activity ahead of a big booking — make sure you've had a credit card transaction or flight credit within the last month, then use Balance Boost to top up at the best possible rate.

## 2. Avios Subscription — From 0.99p per Avios

This is a relatively newer option from BA that works like a monthly direct debit for Avios. You commit to one of four tiers — ranging from 20,000 to 200,000 Avios per year — and receive your points in monthly instalments. If you opt for annual payment rather than monthly billing, you effectively get about two months free, bringing the cost down to roughly 0.99p per Avios on the larger plans.

The obvious limitation here is that your Avios arrive gradually rather than as a lump sum. If you've found a perfect award seat and need 50,000 Avios next week, the subscription isn't going to help. It's very much a long-game strategy for people who know they'll be redeeming regularly and want to steadily build a balance over time without thinking about it.

## 3. Credit Card Sign-Up Bonuses — Effective Cost Under 1p

![Credit card rewards are the fastest way to earn Avios](/images/blog/credit-card.jpg)

If you're based in the UK and you're not using a credit card to earn Avios, you're leaving significant value on the table. The BA American Express cards offer welcome bonuses of 25,000 Avios or more, and the Amex Preferred Rewards Gold earns Membership Rewards points that transfer 1:1 to Avios with its own generous sign-up bonus on top.

When you factor the annual fee against the bonus points, the effective cost per Avios often works out under 1p — and sometimes as low as 0.5p if you were going to make the minimum spend anyway. The downside is that this requires a credit application, meeting minimum spend targets (typically £3,000–5,000 in three months), and paying annual fees that range from £195 to £450 depending on the card. It's not instant gratification, but for UK residents who can meet the spend requirements, credit card bonuses remain the single best long-term strategy for accumulating large Avios balances.

## 4. Finnair Plus Promotions — From ~1.05p per Avios

Here's one that a lot of people overlook. Finnair runs regular promotions where you can purchase Avios through their Finnair Plus programme. Since Finnair joined the Avios family, their points are the same currency — meaning you can buy Avios through Finnair and then transfer them to your British Airways Executive Club account by linking the two programmes.

During the best promotions, particularly the 50% discount deals that come around several times a year, prices drop to around 1.05p per Avios. That's exceptional value for a direct purchase with no strings attached. The main drawback is that promotions are irregular and you can't count on them being available when you need them. You also need a Finnair Plus account, and the transfer to BA requires linking your accounts through the Avios system. It's not complicated, but it's an extra step that puts some people off. For opportunistic buyers who check regularly and are happy to jump on deals when they appear, this is one of the best options available.

## 5. Qatar Airways Privilege Club — From ~1.75p per Avios

![Qatar Airways QSuites — bookable with Avios](/images/blog/qatar-qsuite-cabin.jpg)

Qatar Airways also uses Avios as their loyalty currency and periodically runs purchase promotions through the Privilege Club. Standard pricing starts around 1.75p per Avios, which isn't cheap, but bonus offers can bring this down to more reasonable territory. Prices are typically quoted in USD, so exchange rates matter for UK-based buyers and can work either for or against you depending on when you purchase.

Promotions from Qatar tend to be less frequent than Finnair's, so this isn't something you can rely on as a regular source of cheap Avios. But when Qatar does run a strong promotion and other options aren't available, it's worth considering.

## 6. Buy Directly from BA — 1.77p to 2.45p per Avios

The official ba.com purchase page is the most straightforward option but also comfortably the most expensive. Prices range from £49 for 2,000 Avios (working out to 2.45p each) down to £3,539 for 200,000 Avios (1.77p each at the bulk rate). Even that bulk rate is nearly double what you'd pay through Balance Boost, which tells you everything you need to know about the value proposition here.

Buying directly from BA really only makes sense as a last resort — when no other option is available and you need Avios right now for a booking that won't wait. Before you click that buy button, make sure you've checked every other method on this list first.

## 7. Use a Top-Up Service — Competitive Rates, Fast Delivery

Services like MilesTopUp offer an alternative approach: they transfer Avios directly to your account using credit card points transfer mechanisms. You request a personalised quote based on the quantity you need, pay, and the miles typically arrive within 24–48 hours.

The main advantage here is consistency and convenience. You get competitive rates without having to wait for airline promotions to come around, and there's no requirement for recent earning activity like Balance Boost demands. Top-up services are particularly useful for larger orders where you need a specific number of Avios at a predictable price and don't want to jump through hoops to get them. It's worth getting a quote to compare against whatever other options are available to you at the time.

## Which Method Is Right for You?

![Cathay Pacific A350 — another Oneworld airline where you can spend Avios](/images/blog/cathay-a350-2024.jpg)

The right approach depends entirely on your timeline and situation. If you have several months before you need to book, the unbeatable combination is credit card bonuses plus Balance Boost — earn Avios through your everyday spending, then use Balance Boost at 0.92p to top up your balance to wherever it needs to be. No other method comes close to this on a cost-per-point basis.

If you need Avios within the next few weeks, start by checking whether Finnair or Qatar have any active promotions running. If they do, take advantage. If they don't, a top-up service gives you a reliable price and fast delivery without the uncertainty of waiting for a promotion to appear.

If you need Avios right now — as in today or tomorrow — your options narrow to a top-up service (24–48 hours) or buying directly from BA (instant but expensive). The price difference between these two can be significant, so it's always worth getting a quote before defaulting to the BA website.

If you're still getting to grips with what Avios actually are and how the whole system works, our [complete beginner's guide to Avios](/blog/what-are-avios-beginners-guide) covers everything from earning strategies to the best redemption sweet spots.

One final piece of advice: never get Avios speculatively. Only top up when you have a specific booking in mind and know exactly how many points you need. It's also worth checking the Avios-plus-cash combinations on ba.com, where you can slide a bar to mix points and money on the same booking. Sometimes paying a bit more cash and fewer Avios turns out to be the smarter play.`,

    title: "How to Get Flying Blue Miles in 2026: The Complete Guide",
    excerpt: "Everything you need to know about earning, buying, and maximising Flying Blue miles — from monthly Promo Rewards to transfer partners and sweet spot redemptions.",
    content: `Flying Blue is the loyalty programme of Air France and KLM, and for travellers based in Europe, it's arguably the single most valuable frequent flyer programme to understand. The reason is simple: intra-European award flights start at just 4,000 miles one-way, and every month the programme releases discounted award seats with 25–50% off the standard mileage cost. There's genuinely nothing else like it in the European loyalty landscape.

The challenge, of course, is having enough miles in your account when you spot the perfect award flight. That's what this guide is about — every practical way to build your Flying Blue balance, plus where to spend those miles for maximum value.

## What Makes Flying Blue Worth Your Attention

![KLM Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Amsterdam Schiphol](/images/blog/klm-787-schiphol-2024.jpg)

Before diving into the earning strategies, it's worth understanding what makes Flying Blue genuinely stand apart from the competition. The headline feature is the pricing for intra-European flights. A one-way economy award within Europe costs between 4,000 and 8,000 Flying Blue miles — try finding anything comparable in British Airways Executive Club (where the equivalent starts at 9,500 Avios) or virtually any other European programme.

Then there are the Monthly Promo Rewards, which are Flying Blue's killer feature and something no other major programme offers consistently. Around the first week of every month, Air France and KLM publish a selection of discounted award flights with 25–50% off the standard mileage pricing. A business class flight from Amsterdam to New York that normally costs 70,000 miles might drop to 50,000 during a promo. These deals are available across all cabins — economy, premium economy, and business — and they genuinely transform what's possible with a relatively modest miles balance.

Your Flying Blue miles also give you access to the entire SkyTeam alliance, which means they work on Air France, KLM, Delta, Korean Air, Vietnam Airlines, and more. That's comprehensive global coverage. And unlike some programmes where points expire on a fixed schedule regardless of activity, Flying Blue miles stay alive as long as you earn or spend at least one mile every 24 months.

## Earning Through Credit Card Transfers

![Air France A350-900 — transfer credit card points to fly in style](/images/blog/airfrance-a350.jpg)

The fastest and most efficient way to build a substantial Flying Blue balance is through credit card points transfers. All of the major flexible points programmes — American Express Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Citi ThankYou Rewards, Capital One Miles, and Bilt Rewards — transfer to Flying Blue at a 1:1 ratio. Marriott Bonvoy points also transfer, though at a 3:1 ratio (with a 5,000-mile bonus when you transfer 60,000 Bonvoy points or more).

What makes this particularly powerful is that transfers from Amex, Chase, and Citi are typically instant. That means you can search for an award flight on the Flying Blue website, confirm that the seat you want is available, transfer exactly the number of miles you need from your credit card programme, and complete the booking — all within minutes. There's no waiting around and no risk of the availability disappearing while your miles are in transit.

The real power move, though, is watching for transfer bonuses. Amex and Chase occasionally run promotions offering 20–30% bonus miles on transfers to Flying Blue. When one of these promotions is active, every 10,000 points you transfer becomes 12,000 or 13,000 Flying Blue miles. If you've been accumulating credit card points and waiting for the right moment to move them, a transfer bonus is exactly that moment.

## Earning Through Flying

Every flight on Air France, KLM, or any SkyTeam partner airline earns Flying Blue miles based on your ticket price rather than distance. At the base Explorer level (no status), you earn 4 miles per euro spent on the ticket. This increases to 6 miles per euro with Silver status, 7 with Gold, and 8 with Platinum.

To put that in practical terms, a €500 round-trip flight from Paris to New York in economy earns about 2,000 miles at the base level. That's not going to fill your account overnight, but it adds up meaningfully if you're a regular flyer on Air France, KLM, or SkyTeam routes. And of course, you're earning these miles on flights you'd be taking anyway.

## The Monthly Promo Rewards

![Air France Business Class on the 777-300ER — bookable at a discount during Promo Rewards](/images/blog/airfrance-business-777.jpg)

This deserves its own section because it's genuinely Flying Blue's most distinctive and valuable feature. Around the first week of each month, Air France and KLM publish a list of routes where award flights are available at a significant discount — typically 25% to 50% off the standard mileage price. The discounts apply across all cabins, and they must be booked by the end of the month.

The key to taking advantage of Promo Rewards is being prepared and acting fast. Set a calendar reminder for the 5th of every month and check the promo page as soon as it updates. The best availability — particularly in business class — tends to go within days. A recent example from February 2026 included 25% off on routes between Europe and the US, which brought business class redemptions from Amsterdam or Paris to New York down from the standard 70,000 miles to roughly 50,000. When you consider that the cash fare for that same business class seat is often €2,000 or more, the value is extraordinary.

## Partner Earning and Shopping Portals

Flying Blue has partnerships with a range of hotels, car rental companies, and shopping portals that provide additional earning opportunities. Booking.com offers 2 miles per euro spent plus periodic bonus promotions of 15–30%, and Hyatt awards 500 miles per qualifying stay. On the car rental side, Hertz offers up to 12 miles per euro on electric vehicle rentals. The Air France and KLM shopping portals provide bonus miles at hundreds of online retailers.

None of these individual partnerships are going to transform your miles balance on their own, but they represent free miles on spending you'd likely be doing anyway. Over the course of a year, the cumulative effect of earning through shopping portals, hotel stays, and partner programmes can be surprisingly meaningful.

## Buying Miles or Using a Top-Up Service

Sometimes you find the perfect award seat — maybe it's a Promo Reward business class flight to New York at a discounted rate — but you're 10,000 or 20,000 miles short of being able to book it. Waiting to earn those miles through flying or credit card spending means watching that seat disappear.

Air France and KLM do sell Flying Blue miles directly, though the pricing varies and typically falls in the range of 1.5–3 cents per mile depending on quantity and any active promotions. It's worth checking the Flying Blue website for current rates before purchasing. Top-up services like MilesTopUp offer an alternative: they can add Flying Blue miles to your account within 24–48 hours at competitive rates based on a personalised quote. This approach is worth considering when you need a specific number of miles quickly and the airline's own pricing isn't favourable.

The important thing is to only buy or top up miles when you have a specific booking in mind. Calculate the cost of the additional miles against what you'd pay for the cash fare, and make sure the maths works in your favour. As a general rule, if you're getting more than 1.5 cents of value per mile on the redemption, topping up makes sense.

## Family Pooling

One of Flying Blue's most underappreciated features is the ability to pool miles across up to 8 accounts. This is a genuine game-changer for families and couples — instead of each person slowly accumulating their own small balance, you can combine everyone's earning into a single pool and reach redemption thresholds much faster.

Setting up family pooling is free through the Flying Blue website. Each member continues to earn miles into their own account, but the combined balance becomes accessible for bookings by any member of the pool. If you have a partner, children, or family members who also fly occasionally, this is absolutely worth configuring.

## Where to Spend Flying Blue Miles for Maximum Value

![Paris — one of Flying Blue's major hubs](/images/blog/paris-eiffel-aerial.jpg)

Understanding where your miles deliver the best value helps you set realistic earning targets and make smarter decisions about when to redeem versus when to save.

For intra-European travel, Flying Blue is virtually unbeatable. One-way economy awards of 4,000–8,000 miles cover routes like Amsterdam to Rome, Paris to Barcelona, or any number of city-to-city hops across the continent. When the cash fare for these routes regularly exceeds €100, you're getting exceptional value from a very small number of miles.

The transatlantic sweet spot is business class between Europe and North America. A standard award costs 50,000–70,000 miles one-way, but during Promo Rewards this can drop to 35,000–50,000. A lie-flat seat from Paris or Amsterdam to New York for 50,000 miles is outstanding value when the cash fare is often €2,000 or more. This is the redemption that makes the whole Flying Blue ecosystem worth engaging with.

For longer routes to Asia and the Middle East, expect to spend 30,000–50,000 miles one-way in economy for destinations like Dubai or Tokyo. Business class to these destinations requires more, but Promo Rewards can bring the pricing into very attractive territory.

## How Flying Blue Compares

For intra-European travel and Air France/KLM routes, Flying Blue is the clear winner. No other major programme comes close to the 4,000-mile starting price for European flights, and the monthly Promo Rewards add a dimension of value that simply doesn't exist elsewhere.

Where Flying Blue is less competitive is on long-haul premium cabin bookings through partner airlines. British Airways Avios offers access to exceptional products like Qatar Airways Q Suites and Cathay Pacific business class at compelling prices — products that Flying Blue can't match because they're on different alliances. For UK-based travellers, the ideal strategy is honestly to collect both currencies and deploy each where it's strongest.

## Putting It All Together

Building a useful Flying Blue balance is about combining multiple earning strategies rather than relying on any single approach. Start with a flexible points credit card — Amex or Chase — and earn on your everyday spending. Watch for transfer bonus promotions and move points to Flying Blue when the rates are favourable. Check the Promo Rewards page religiously on the first week of every month. Set up family pooling if you have a partner or family who also travel. And when you find a great award seat but you're a few thousand miles short, don't let it slip away — top up the difference rather than watching the availability disappear.

The goal isn't to hoard miles indefinitely. It's to have enough in the bank when that perfect award seat appears — and to be ready to book it before someone else does. And if you're weighing up whether Flying Blue or Avios is the better programme for your travel style, we've written a detailed [Avios vs Flying Blue comparison](/blog/avios-vs-flying-blue-which-miles-should-you-get) that breaks down exactly where each currency shines.`,

    excerpt: "Avios are the loyalty currency used by British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, Qatar Airways and more. Here's everything you need to know — what they're worth, how to earn them, and how to use them.",
    content: `You've probably heard people talk about Avios. Maybe a colleague casually mentioned flying business class to New York "basically for free," or you spotted the word on your British Airways booking confirmation and wondered what it actually meant. Perhaps you've got a few thousand sitting in an Executive Club account somewhere and never really thought about what to do with them.

Whatever brought you here, this guide is going to walk you through everything — what Avios are, why they matter, how the whole system works, and most importantly, how to make the most of them. I'll try to keep things practical and honest rather than drowning you in jargon.

## The Basics: What Avios Actually Are

![British Airways A350-1000 — the biggest airline in the Avios family](/images/blog/ba-a350-heathrow-2025.jpg)

At its core, Avios is a loyalty currency — think of it like air miles, except that it's shared across a whole group of airlines rather than being locked to just one. The name "Avios" has been around since 2011, when British Airways merged its old BA Miles programme with Iberia's. The idea was to create a single, flexible currency that could be earned and spent across multiple carriers.

Today, Avios is the common currency for British Airways Executive Club, Iberia Plus, Aer Lingus AerClub, Vueling Club, Qatar Airways Privilege Club, and Finnair Plus. That's six different airline programmes all using the same points. What makes this genuinely useful — rather than just a marketing exercise — is that you can earn Avios with one airline and spend them with any of the others. So if you've been collecting Avios through a UK credit card, you could use those points to book a Qatar Airways Q Suite from Doha, or an Aer Lingus business class flight from Dublin to New York, or a British Airways seat from London to anywhere they fly.

The system also extends beyond just these six airlines. Because British Airways is part of the Oneworld alliance, you can use your Avios to book reward flights on American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Qantas, and a dozen other carriers. That's what makes Avios one of the most versatile loyalty currencies in the world — it's not just a British Airways thing.

## What's an Avios Actually Worth?

This is the question that everyone asks, and the honest answer is that it completely depends on how you use them. There's no fixed value — one Avios could be worth half a penny or three pence, depending on what you redeem it for.

The general benchmark most people use is around 1p per Avios. If you're consistently getting at least that much value from your redemptions, you're doing well. But the real sweet spot comes when you use Avios for expensive flights — particularly long-haul business and first class — where the value per point can be exceptional.

Let me give you a concrete example. A short-haul economy flight from London to Dublin might cost 13,000 Avios plus about £1 in taxes. If the same ticket costs £80 in cash, you're getting roughly 0.6p per Avios. That's okay, but nothing to write home about. Now consider a business class flight from London to New York, which typically costs around 60,000 Avios plus £600 in taxes and surcharges. If the cash fare for that same business class seat is £2,500, your Avios are effectively worth about 3.2p each. That's over five times more value from the same currency, just by choosing a different redemption.

The takeaway here is straightforward: Avios deliver the best value when you use them for flights that would be prohibitively expensive to pay cash for. Using them on a £40 Ryanair-priced route doesn't make much sense. Using them on a £3,000 business class seat absolutely does.

## How to Earn Avios

There are plenty of ways to build an Avios balance, and most people end up using a combination of methods. The key is understanding which approaches give you the most points for the least effort.

![Cathay Pacific A350 — every Oneworld partner flight earns Avios](/images/blog/cathay-a350-2024.jpg)

**Credit cards** are by far the fastest route to a large Avios balance for most people. In the UK, the British Airways American Express earns Avios directly on every purchase, typically at a rate of 1 to 1.5 Avios per pound spent. The sign-up bonuses alone can be worth 25,000 Avios or more. The Amex Preferred Rewards Gold is another popular option — it earns Membership Rewards points that transfer to Avios at a 1:1 ratio, and it comes with a generous sign-up bonus. If you put £2,000 a month of regular spending on one of these cards, you'll accumulate roughly 24,000 Avios per year before any bonuses. That's enough for several short-haul flights or a meaningful contribution towards a long-haul redemption.

**Flying** is the traditional way to earn, of course. Every flight on British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, or any Oneworld partner earns Avios based on the route distance and your cabin class. A London to New York economy flight earns around 4,500 Avios, while the same route in business class earns roughly 9,000. The important thing to remember is that you can credit flights on any Oneworld airline to your BA Executive Club account — so even if you're flying American Airlines domestically in the US or Cathay Pacific across Asia, those flights can add to your Avios balance.

**Shopping portals and partners** provide a steady drip of bonus Avios on purchases you'd make anyway. The BA Shopping portal offers 2 to 15 Avios per pound at hundreds of online retailers, layered on top of whatever your credit card already earns. Nectar points from Sainsbury's transfer to Avios (400 Nectar = 250 Avios), and hotel stays with Marriott Bonvoy or Hyatt can also generate Avios. Individually, these are small amounts, but they compound nicely over time.

**Purchasing directly or topping up** is an option when you're close to having enough Avios for a specific booking. British Airways sells Avios on their website, though the pricing isn't always competitive. Balance Boost offers better rates if you've had recent earning activity. And top-up services like MilesTopUp can transfer Avios to your account within 24–48 hours at competitive rates — useful when you've found the perfect award seat and just need a few thousand more points to book it. We covered every purchase option in detail in our [guide to the cheapest ways to get Avios in 2026](/blog/cheapest-way-to-get-avios-2026).

## Spending Avios: Where the Real Value Is

This is where it gets genuinely exciting. The whole point of accumulating Avios is to use them for flights you wouldn't otherwise pay cash for, and there are some truly outstanding redemptions available if you know where to look.

![British Airways Club Suite — where Avios deliver exceptional value](/images/blog/ba-club-suite.jpg)

The primary use case is booking reward flights. Through ba.com, you can search and book flights on British Airways and all of their Oneworld partners. Pricing is based on route distance and cabin class. A one-way economy flight within Europe starts at around 9,500 Avios during off-peak periods. London to New York in economy runs about 26,000 Avios one-way, while business class on the same route is 60,000 Avios. For the ultimate splurge, first class from London to destinations like Cape Town or Singapore costs around 102,000 Avios.

There's one important caveat that catches people off guard: on top of your Avios, you also pay taxes, fees, and fuel surcharges. On British Airways flights specifically, these surcharges can be substantial — sometimes £400 or more on a long-haul return in business class. This is arguably BA's biggest drawback as a programme. The good news is that other airlines in the Avios family charge far less. If you book the exact same Oneworld partner flight through Iberia's website using your Avios, the surcharges are often dramatically lower. An Aer Lingus transatlantic business class booking might come with just £50 in fees versus £400+ through BA. Same seat, same Avios cost, vastly different cash outlay. This is one of the most valuable tricks in the Avios ecosystem.

Beyond flights, you can also use Avios to upgrade an existing cash ticket to a higher cabin, combine Avios and cash on the same booking through BA's "part-pay" slider, or redeem for hotel stays through the Executive Club portal. In practice, though, flights are where the value is. Hotel redemptions through Avios tend to offer poor value compared to using hotel loyalty programmes directly.

## The Sweet Spots Every Avios Collector Should Know

Certain Avios redemptions stand head and shoulders above the rest, and knowing about them can be the difference between getting decent value and getting spectacular value.

**Qatar Airways Q Suites** are widely considered the best business class product in the world, and they're bookable with Avios. A one-way flight from Doha to destinations across Asia, Africa, or the Americas costs between 42,500 and 75,000 Avios with minimal surcharges. When the equivalent cash fare is often £3,000 or more, the maths is extraordinary.

**Aer Lingus transatlantic** flights from Dublin to US cities in business class cost 50,000 Avios with very low surcharges. If you can position yourself to Dublin — even factoring in a cheap Ryanair flight — this is one of the best value redemptions in the entire programme.

**Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines** across Asia also deserve special mention. Using Avios on these carriers means minimal surcharges and access to genuinely world-class business and first class products. A Cathay Pacific business class flight from Hong Kong to London for 75,000 Avios with under £50 in taxes is remarkable value when the walk-up fare can exceed £4,000.

**Off-peak short-haul** flights within Europe at 9,500 Avios one-way are the unsung heroes for frequent travellers. A weekend in Barcelona or a quick trip to Dublin for less than 10,000 Avios — when the cash fare might be £100 or more — adds up to significant savings over the course of a year.

## Do Avios Expire?

Avios expire after 36 months of inactivity, meaning if you don't earn or spend a single Avios for three years, your entire balance is wiped. That sounds harsh, but in practice it's easy to avoid. Almost any activity resets the 36-month clock — a single credit card transaction that earns Avios, a small purchase through the shopping portal, transferring one Avios point between household accounts, or even just collecting Avios from a Nectar conversion.

My advice is to set a calendar reminder for every 30 months. If you haven't had any Avios activity by then, do something small to reset the timer. It would be a shame to lose a balance you've spent years building.

## How Avios Stack Up Against the Competition

![Qatar Airways A350 — one of many airlines where you can use Avios](/images/blog/qatar-a350.jpg)

No loyalty currency exists in a vacuum, so it's worth understanding how Avios compare to the alternatives. If you're based in Europe, the two most relevant competitors are Flying Blue (Air France/KLM) and Virgin Atlantic Points.

Flying Blue beats Avios for intra-European flights — their pricing starts at just 4,000 miles one-way compared to 9,500 Avios, and they run monthly Promo Rewards with 25–50% discounts. For short-haul European travel, Flying Blue is simply better value. If you want the full picture on Flying Blue, we've written a [complete guide to getting Flying Blue miles](/blog/how-to-get-flying-blue-miles-guide) that covers everything from Promo Rewards to transfer partners. Where Avios pull ahead is on long-haul premium cabins, particularly through partners like Qatar Airways and Cathay Pacific that Flying Blue can't access. The smart approach, if you're serious about award travel, is to collect both currencies and use each where it's strongest.

Virgin Atlantic Points are excellent for specific use cases — particularly Upper Class to the US or Delta One flights — but the programme is far more limited in scope. Virgin's partner network is tiny compared to Oneworld, which means your redemption options are far more constrained.

Lufthansa Miles & More deserves a mention mostly as a cautionary tale. The programme has famously poor redemption rates, high surcharges, and limited award availability. If you're choosing between accumulating Miles & More and Avios, it's not a close contest.

Overall, Avios are arguably the most versatile loyalty currency available to travellers based in the UK and Europe. The combination of British Airways' extensive network, Oneworld alliance access, and the ability to use points across six different airline programmes makes them genuinely hard to beat.

## Getting Started with Avios

If you've read this far and you're convinced that Avios are worth collecting, here's the practical bit. Start by joining the BA Executive Club — it's completely free and takes about two minutes on ba.com. Then consider picking up an Avios-earning credit card, which will be your primary accumulation engine. Link your BA, Iberia, and Aer Lingus accounts so you can freely move Avios between them and book through whichever programme offers the best surcharges.

Most importantly, set a goal. Decide where you want to fly, figure out how many Avios you'll need, and work backwards from there. Building a meaningful balance typically takes 6 to 12 months of focused earning — but when you're stretching out in a lie-flat business class seat on a flight you effectively paid for with your supermarket shopping, the whole exercise feels very much worth the effort.`,

    excerpt: "British Airways Avios and Air France/KLM Flying Blue are the two most valuable loyalty currencies in Europe — but they excel in very different areas. Here's an honest comparison to help you decide which to focus on.",
    content: `If you're based in Europe and you're serious about using miles for award flights, you've almost certainly encountered the same dilemma I did a few years ago: should you collect Avios or Flying Blue miles? Both programmes are genuinely excellent — arguably the two best loyalty currencies available to European travellers — but they have very different strengths, and the right choice depends entirely on how and where you like to travel.

I've spent a lot of time with both programmes, and I can tell you upfront that the answer for most people isn't actually "one or the other." It's both. But that doesn't mean they're interchangeable, and understanding where each one excels will save you from making expensive mistakes with your points. So let's break this down properly.

![British Airways Club Suites on the 787-10 — the flagship Avios product](/images/blog/ba-club-suites-787.jpg)

## The Programmes at a Glance

Avios is the shared loyalty currency used by British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, Vueling, Qatar Airways, and Finnair. If you're not familiar with how it all works, our [complete beginner's guide to Avios](/blog/what-are-avios-beginners-guide) walks through the whole ecosystem in detail. Because British Airways is a member of the Oneworld alliance, your Avios can also be used to book flights on American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Qantas, and about a dozen other carriers. The programme is managed through multiple accounts — BA Executive Club, Iberia Plus, Aer Lingus AerClub — and you can move Avios between them freely, which creates some interesting opportunities for optimising surcharges and routing.

Flying Blue is the loyalty programme of Air France and KLM, and it sits within the SkyTeam alliance. That gives you access to Delta, Korean Air, Vietnam Airlines, and several other partners. Unlike the fragmented Avios system, Flying Blue is a single programme with one account, one balance, and one set of rules. It's simpler to manage, and it has some unique features — particularly the Monthly Promo Rewards — that make it genuinely distinctive. We've covered all the earning strategies and sweet spots in our [complete guide to getting Flying Blue miles](/blog/how-to-get-flying-blue-miles-guide).

Both programmes earn miles through flights, credit card transfers (Amex, Chase, Citi, and others all transfer to both), and various shopping partners. Both have reasonable expiration policies — Avios expire after 36 months of inactivity, Flying Blue after 24 months, though in both cases any earning or spending activity resets the clock. And both offer access to genuinely exciting redemptions that can save you thousands of pounds on flights you'd otherwise never be able to afford.

## Short-Haul European Flights: Flying Blue Wins Convincingly

This is the single biggest area where the two programmes diverge, and it's not even close. Flying Blue prices one-way economy flights within Europe starting at just 4,000 miles. Avios, by contrast, starts at 9,500 for the equivalent flight during off-peak periods and can be higher during peak times. That's more than double the cost for essentially the same type of route.

![European city breaks are where Flying Blue delivers unbeatable value](/images/blog/barcelona-aerial.jpg)

But the pricing advantage is only part of the story. Flying Blue also runs Monthly Promo Rewards — a feature that genuinely has no equivalent in the Avios world. Around the first week of every month, Air France and KLM publish a selection of routes where award flights are discounted by 25–50%. These promos cover economy, premium economy, and business class, and they can bring already-cheap European flights down to absurdly low mileage costs. A 4,000-mile flight discounted by 50% becomes 2,000 miles. That's barely the cost of a supermarket shop in credit card points.

If you primarily fly within Europe — weekend city breaks, short business trips, visiting family in another European country — Flying Blue is the clear winner and it's not really a debate. You'll get at least twice as many flights from the same number of miles, and the Promo Rewards add another layer of value on top.

The one caveat is that Flying Blue's European award availability can be tighter than Avios, particularly on popular routes during holidays. BA tends to release more award seats on their own metal, so if flexibility of dates matters more to you than the per-flight cost, that's worth factoring in.

## Long-Haul Premium Cabins: Avios Has the Edge

Where Avios truly shines is in getting you into business and first class seats on long-haul flights, particularly through partner airlines. The Oneworld alliance includes some of the best premium cabin products in the world, and they're all bookable with Avios at reasonable rates with manageable surcharges — if you know the tricks.

Qatar Airways Q Suites are widely regarded as the best business class product flying today, and they're bookable with Avios at between 42,500 and 75,000 points one-way depending on the route. The surcharges are minimal when booked through Qatar's own Privilege Club. Cathay Pacific's business class — another phenomenal product — costs 75,000 Avios from Hong Kong to London with under £50 in taxes. Japan Airlines, Qantas, and American Airlines all offer competitive redemption rates through Avios as well.

Flying Blue can't match this breadth of premium cabin access. SkyTeam has some excellent products — Korean Air's first class is spectacular, and Delta One is solid — but the overall selection of world-class business and first class products is narrower than what Oneworld offers. Air France and KLM's own business class is perfectly good but doesn't quite reach the heights of Qatar's Q Suites or Cathay's latest cabins.

![Long-haul business class — where Avios redemptions deliver the most value](/images/blog/qatar-qsuite-cabin.jpg)

There's also the surcharge question. British Airways is notorious for adding hefty fuel surcharges to award tickets on their own flights — sometimes £400 or more on a long-haul return. But here's the thing that experienced Avios collectors know: you can avoid most of these surcharges by booking through Iberia Plus or Aer Lingus AerClub instead of BA Executive Club. The same Oneworld partner flight, same Avios cost, dramatically lower cash outlay. Flying Blue's surcharges on Air France and KLM metal are more moderate and predictable, which is simpler but doesn't offer the same optimisation opportunities.

## Transatlantic Flights: It Depends on Your Route

For flights between Europe and North America — probably the most popular long-haul redemption for European travellers — both programmes offer compelling options, and the winner depends on your specific routing.

Flying Blue is exceptional for flights from Amsterdam or Paris to US cities. A standard one-way business class award costs 50,000–72,000 miles, but during Monthly Promo Rewards this can drop to 35,000–55,000. When you consider that a cash business class fare on Air France or KLM to New York is often €2,000–3,000, the value is extraordinary. The Promo Rewards make Flying Blue the clear winner if you can be flexible with your dates and are happy to route through Amsterdam or Paris.

Avios counters with more route options. BA flies from London to a huge number of US destinations, and through American Airlines you can reach virtually anywhere in the Americas. The Aer Lingus transatlantic route from Dublin is a particular sweet spot — 50,000 Avios one-way in business class with very low surcharges. If you can position yourself to Dublin cheaply, this is one of the best-value transatlantic redemptions in any programme. We covered the full pricing breakdown in our [guide to the cheapest ways to get Avios](/blog/cheapest-way-to-get-avios-2026).

## Earning Miles: A Virtual Tie

Both programmes benefit from the same credit card transfer ecosystem, which makes the earning side largely equivalent. Amex Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, and Citi ThankYou points all transfer to both Avios and Flying Blue at a 1:1 ratio. This means you can accumulate flexible points and then decide at the moment of booking which programme to transfer them to — which is honestly the smartest strategy.

Where things differ slightly is in co-branded credit cards. In the UK, the BA Amex cards earn Avios directly and are among the most popular travel credit cards available. There's no equivalent direct-earning Flying Blue credit card in the UK market. In the Netherlands and France, the situation is reversed — there are co-branded Flying Blue cards that earn miles directly.

Transfer bonuses are worth watching for both programmes. Amex and Chase periodically offer 20–30% bonus miles on transfers to both Avios and Flying Blue, and timing your transfers to coincide with these promotions can meaningfully stretch your points balance.

## Getting More Miles When You Need Them

Both programmes sell miles directly, though the pricing and frequency of promotions varies. Avios has more options here — Balance Boost offers rates as low as 0.92p per Avios if you've had recent earning activity, the Avios Subscription provides a monthly drip at competitive rates, and Finnair regularly runs purchase promotions. Flying Blue's direct purchase pricing is less consistent, and they don't have an equivalent to Balance Boost.

If you need to top up your balance for a specific booking, services like MilesTopUp can add either Avios or Flying Blue miles to your account within 24–48 hours, which is useful when you've found the perfect award seat and just need a few thousand more points to secure it.

## Miles Expiration: Flying Blue Is Stricter

Avios expire after 36 months of inactivity, while Flying Blue miles expire after 24 months. In both cases, any earning or spending activity resets the clock, so expiration is rarely an issue for active collectors. But if you're someone who goes through long periods without flying or using credit cards, the extra 12 months that Avios provides is a meaningful safety buffer.

Flying Blue's 24-month policy means you need to be slightly more intentional about keeping your balance active. The easiest way is to earn a few miles through a shopping portal transaction every year or two — it costs nothing and keeps your entire balance alive.

## So Which Should You Choose?

Here's my honest recommendation based on different travel profiles.

If you mostly fly within Europe — city breaks, short trips, visiting friends and family across the continent — focus on Flying Blue. The pricing is simply unbeatable for short-haul, and the Monthly Promo Rewards add extraordinary value. You'll get significantly more flights per mile than you would with Avios on these routes.

If you're targeting long-haul premium cabins — business class to Asia, first class to Africa, or anything involving Qatar, Cathay, or Japan Airlines — focus on Avios. The Oneworld partner network for premium cabin redemptions is broader and the products are generally better than what SkyTeam offers.

If you fly transatlantic regularly, it genuinely depends on your preferred routing. Amsterdam or Paris to the US? Flying Blue, especially with Promo Rewards. London or Dublin to the US? Avios, especially using the Aer Lingus route.

If you're a generalist who wants maximum flexibility — and this is the category most serious points collectors fall into — collect both. Use a flexible points credit card like the Amex Gold or Chase card, accumulate transferable points, and move them to whichever programme offers the best deal for each specific booking. This is the strategy that extracts the most value over time, because you're never locked into one programme's limitations.

## The Strategy I'd Recommend

The ideal setup for a European-based traveller looks something like this: earn flexible credit card points that transfer to both programmes. Check Flying Blue's Promo Rewards at the start of every month for cheap European flights and discounted long-haul deals. Use Avios for premium cabin partner bookings and the specific sweet spots where Oneworld excels. Keep a small balance in both programmes to prevent expiration, and transfer the bulk of your points only when you have a specific booking in mind.

The travellers who get the most value from the miles game aren't the ones who pick a single programme and stick with it dogmatically. They're the ones who understand the strengths of each currency and deploy them strategically. Avios and Flying Blue aren't competitors in your wallet — they're complementary tools, and using both well is how you turn credit card points into genuinely life-changing travel experiences.`,

    title: "The 7 Best Avios Redemptions in 2026: Sweet Spots That Deliver Insane Value",
    excerpt: "From Qatar QSuites at 3p per Avios to Aer Lingus transatlantic with almost no surcharges — these are the redemptions that make collecting Avios genuinely worthwhile.",
    content: `There are hundreds of ways to spend Avios, and most of them are mediocre. A domestic UK economy flight here, an overpriced hotel redemption there — perfectly fine, but nothing that makes you feel particularly clever about the whole loyalty game. Then there are the redemptions that make you sit back and think: "I cannot believe this is legal."

Those are the ones we're going to talk about today. I've spent years testing different Avios redemptions across the Oneworld alliance, and these seven consistently deliver the best value. Some of them are well-known in the points community; others are genuinely underrated. All of them share the same quality: when you calculate the cost per Avios against what you'd pay in cash, the maths is almost absurdly good.

If you're new to Avios and want to understand the basics first, start with our [complete beginner's guide to Avios](/blog/what-are-avios-beginners-guide). If you already know the system and just want to know where to spend your points for maximum impact, read on.

## 1. Qatar Airways QSuites — The Gold Standard

![Qatar Airways QSuites — widely considered the best business class in the world](/images/blog/qatar-qsuite-cabin.jpg)

Let's start with the redemption that single-handedly justifies the entire Avios ecosystem for many collectors. Qatar Airways QSuites is not just a business class product — it's a private suite with a closing door, a lie-flat bed that's genuinely comfortable for sleeping, restaurant-quality dining, and service that makes you feel like you're the only person on the aircraft. Multiple publications have rated it the best business class in the world, and having flown it, I wouldn't argue.

The Avios pricing is where it gets exciting. A one-way QSuites flight from Doha to destinations across the network costs between 42,500 and 75,000 Avios depending on the route. Doha to Singapore is 70,000 Avios. Doha to Cape Town is 63,000. Doha to New York is 75,000. And here's the crucial part: when you book through Qatar's own Privilege Club (which uses the same Avios currency), the surcharges are minimal — typically under £50.

Compare that to the cash fare. A QSuites ticket from Doha to New York regularly sells for £3,000 to £4,500 one-way. At 75,000 Avios plus £50, you're getting roughly 4p to 6p of value per Avios. That's four to six times the standard 1p benchmark. If you only ever make one Avios redemption in your life, make it this one.

**Pro tip:** Qatar releases award availability about 361 days in advance, and the best seats go fast. Set a calendar reminder and search as soon as your travel dates open up. Also, make sure you've linked your BA Executive Club and Qatar Privilege Club accounts so you can transfer Avios between them instantly.

## 2. Aer Lingus Transatlantic Business Class — Europe's Best-Kept Secret

![Aer Lingus business class lie-flat seat — your gateway to cheap transatlantic travel](/images/blog/aer-lingus-business-seat.jpg)

This is the redemption I recommend more than any other to friends who are just getting started with Avios. Aer Lingus flies from Dublin to a dozen US cities — including New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Miami — and their business class is bookable with Avios at just 50,000 points one-way.

That alone would be competitive, but the real magic is in the surcharges. While British Airways might charge £400 or more in fuel surcharges on a similar transatlantic business class award, Aer Lingus typically charges under £100 in total taxes and fees. Some routes come in under £50. You read that right — a lie-flat transatlantic business class seat for 50,000 Avios and fifty quid.

The product itself is solid. It's not QSuites, but you get a lie-flat seat, decent food, and a perfectly comfortable overnight experience. For the price, it's extraordinary value. The trick is positioning: you need to get yourself to Dublin, which for UK-based travellers is easy and cheap (Ryanair often has flights for £20–30). Even from continental Europe, a budget carrier to Dublin plus the Aer Lingus business class to the US works out far better value than almost any other option.

**Availability tip:** Aer Lingus releases award space in waves, and it can be patchy on popular routes during summer. The sweet spot is shoulder season — April/May and September/October — when availability is much better and Dublin itself is gorgeous.

## 3. Cathay Pacific Business Class — Asia Done Right

![Cathay Pacific A350 — one of Asia's finest business class products](/images/blog/cathay-a350-2024.jpg)

Cathay Pacific's business class has been a consistent favourite among premium travellers for years, and the Avios redemption rates make it accessible to anyone with a reasonable points balance. A one-way business class flight from Hong Kong to London costs 75,000 Avios, and the surcharges are refreshingly low — typically under £80.

When you consider that the walk-up fare for Cathay business class from Hong Kong to London frequently exceeds £3,500, you're looking at roughly 4.5p per Avios. That's exceptional. And unlike some business class products that look good on paper but disappoint in practice, Cathay's product genuinely delivers — their latest reverse herringbone seats offer direct aisle access, excellent bedding, and some of the best catering in the sky.

The Hong Kong hub also opens up connections across Asia. You can use Cathay to reach Tokyo, Singapore, Bangkok, Sydney, and dozens of other destinations, all bookable with Avios. If you're planning an Asia trip, building your itinerary around Cathay Pacific redemptions is one of the smartest moves you can make.

**Routing hack:** If you can't find availability on the direct Hong Kong to London route, check the Hong Kong to Manchester or Hong Kong to Dublin routings. These often have better award availability and can be combined with a cheap connecting flight to your final destination.

## 4. Japan Airlines First Class — The Ultimate Splurge

![Japan Airlines First Class — an unforgettable experience bookable with Avios](/images/blog/jal-first-class.jpg)

If you've ever wondered what it's like to fly first class on a Japanese airline, Japan Airlines will make you a convert for life. JAL First Class is an experience that transcends transportation — we're talking about individual suites with Airweave mattresses, a curated multi-course kaiseki menu, premium Japanese whisky, and service so attentive it borders on telepathic.

The damage? 112,500 Avios one-way from Tokyo to London in First Class. That sounds like a lot until you look at the cash fare, which regularly exceeds £8,000. At that price, you're extracting over 7p per Avios — the highest value redemption on this entire list. The surcharges are reasonable too, typically around £100-150.

JAL First Class availability is limited, and you'll need to plan well ahead. The airline releases award seats about 360 days out, and competition is fierce. But if you can find availability, this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that costs less in Avios than many people spend on a business class ticket.

**Key detail:** Book through British Airways Executive Club for the best Avios pricing. JAL's own Mileage Bank programme charges significantly more for the same seats.

## 5. Off-Peak Short-Haul Europe — The Everyday Sweet Spot

![European city break — Barcelona, one of many destinations reachable for under 10,000 Avios](/images/blog/europe-city-break.jpg)

Not every great Avios redemption involves lie-flat seats and champagne. One of the most consistently valuable uses of Avios is something far more mundane: short-haul economy flights within Europe during off-peak periods.

British Airways charges just 9,500 Avios one-way for flights up to 1,150 miles during off-peak dates — a category that covers most of Europe from London. Barcelona, Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, Berlin, Dublin, Lisbon — all reachable for under 10,000 Avios. The surcharges on these flights are low too, typically £1 plus the standard airport tax.

Now, 9,500 Avios for a short-haul economy flight might not sound thrilling. But consider the cash alternative: a peak-time London to Barcelona return on BA can easily cost £200 or more. The same flights booked with Avios cost 19,000 points and about £40 in taxes. If you have an Avios-earning credit card generating 1 Avios per pound of spend, that's the equivalent of turning £19,000 of credit card spending into a free European trip. Or, if you've accumulated Avios through bonuses or [topping up at competitive rates](/blog/cheapest-way-to-get-avios-2026), the economics are even better.

The key word here is "off-peak." BA publishes an off-peak calendar, and the dates are more generous than you might expect — most of the year qualifies, with the main exceptions being school holidays, Christmas/New Year, and parts of summer. If you can be even slightly flexible with your dates, short-haul off-peak redemptions deliver solid, reliable value every single time.

**Worth noting:** For intra-European flights specifically, Flying Blue miles from Air France/KLM start at just 4,000 miles one-way — less than half the Avios price. If you primarily fly short-haul within Europe, it's worth comparing both programmes. We broke this down in detail in our [Avios vs Flying Blue comparison](/blog/avios-vs-flying-blue-which-miles-should-you-get).

## 6. British Airways First Class on Select Routes

![British Airways First Class cabin — select routes offer outstanding Avios value](/images/blog/ba-first-class-cabin.jpg)

BA's own First Class gets a mixed reputation in the points world, largely because the surcharges on BA-operated flights can be eye-watering. But on select routes, the combination of a premium product and manageable total cost makes this a worthwhile redemption.

The standout is London to São Paulo or Johannesburg in First Class: 102,000 Avios one-way. Yes, the surcharges are around £350-400, which stings. But the cash fare for BA First to South Africa is typically £5,000 to £7,000. Even after the surcharges, you're extracting over 4.5p per Avios, and you get the full First Class experience — a proper suite, excellent champagne, and the First Class lounge at Heathrow T5 with its own restaurant.

The trick to making BA First work is choosing routes where cash fares are especially high relative to the Avios cost. Routes to South America, South Africa, and Australia tend to have the highest cash fares and therefore the best Avios value. Avoid using Avios for BA First to New York — the cash fares are lower and the surcharges make the proposition much less compelling.

**Surcharge hack:** Check if the same route is available as an Iberia-operated flight. If it is, booking through Iberia Plus instead of BA Executive Club can dramatically reduce the surcharges while costing the same Avios.

## 7. American Airlines Domestic First Class — For US Trips

Not everyone using Avios is crossing oceans. If you're visiting the US and need to get around domestically, American Airlines' domestic first class is bookable with Avios at very reasonable rates — typically 15,000 to 25,000 Avios one-way depending on distance, with almost zero surcharges.

Domestic first class in the US isn't the same luxury as international business class — it's more like a wider seat with more legroom, a meal, and free drinks. But on longer domestic routes (New York to Los Angeles, Miami to San Francisco, Dallas to Seattle), the upgrade from a cramped economy seat to a comfortable first class experience is genuinely worthwhile, and the cash price difference can be $300–$500 or more.

The real trick here is combining this with an international Avios redemption. Fly Aer Lingus business class from Dublin to New York for 50,000 Avios, then connect onwards in American Airlines domestic first class for another 15,000 Avios. For 65,000 Avios total, you've crossed the Atlantic in a lie-flat seat and then continued domestically in first class — an itinerary that would cost well over $4,000 in cash fares.

## How to Find Award Availability

Having a list of sweet spots is only useful if you can actually find available seats. Here are the practical steps:

**Search early.** Most airlines release award availability 330–361 days before departure. For premium cabin sweet spots, searching as soon as dates open is essential — QSuites, JAL First, and Cathay business class availability gets snapped up quickly.

**Be flexible with dates.** Even one or two days of flexibility can be the difference between finding availability and getting shut out. Mid-week flights (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) generally have the best award availability.

**Use the right booking portal.** Not all Avios booking engines show the same availability. BA.com is good for Oneworld partners, but Qatar's own website sometimes shows QSuites availability that BA doesn't. Similarly, Iberia's website can surface availability that BA misses on certain routes.

**Check back often.** Airlines regularly release additional award seats, particularly as the departure date approaches. If you can't find availability 11 months out, check again at 6 months, 3 months, and even 2-4 weeks before departure.

## The Bottom Line

The difference between a mediocre Avios redemption and a spectacular one can be 5x or more in terms of value per point. These seven sweet spots represent the best that the Avios ecosystem has to offer in 2026 — from the unmatched luxury of Qatar QSuites and JAL First Class to the everyday practicality of off-peak European flights.

The common thread? All of these redemptions deliver significantly more value than buying the equivalent cash ticket, and all of them are consistently available if you know where and when to look. Build your Avios strategy around these sweet spots, and you'll never feel like you're settling for a subpar use of your points.

If you're short on Avios for any of these bookings, don't let the perfect redemption slip away. Check whether [topping up your balance](/blog/cheapest-way-to-get-avios-2026) makes sense — even at 1.5p per Avios, a QSuites redemption worth 5p per point leaves you well ahead.`,
