## 🎯 Core Strategy

### Phase 1: Karma Building (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Establish credibility before posting links  
**Target:** 100-200 comment karma minimum

**Approach:**
- Answer questions in target subreddits

- r/churning (340k members - high quality audience)
- r/Avios (2k members - niche but relevant)
- r/travel (23M members - too broad, low priority)

## 🧠 Karma-Building Comments (Phase 1)

### Week 1: Comment-Only Strategy

**Monday-Wednesday (3 comments/day):**
Focus: Answering questions, no links

**Comment Template #1: Award Availability**
```
Subreddit: r/awardtravel
Topic: "Need help finding business class to Japan"

Response:
"JAL First is actually easier to find than you'd think if you're flexible with dates. I'd search 330-350 days out—that's when JAL releases the bulk of award space. Use British Airways website to search (even if you're using AA miles) because BA shows all OneWorld availability including JAL First.

For business, consider ANA via Virgin Atlantic miles if you have Amex points—often has better availability than ANA's own program. Route-wise, Tokyo is easiest but Osaka sometimes has hidden gems.

What's your rough timeframe and home airport?"
```

**Comment Template #2: Program Comparison**
```
Subreddit: r/churning
Topic: "Avios vs Flying Blue for Europe trips?"

Response:
"Depends on your routes. Avios is unbeatable for short-haul if you're based near a BA hub—London to Spain/Italy/Greece is 13,000-15,000 Avios vs 25,000-35,000 Flying Blue. Plus Iberia/Aer Lingus access.

Flying Blue shines for long-haul business and those monthly Promo Rewards. I've seen Paris-NYC drop to 53,000 miles during promos vs 62,500+ regular pricing. Also, KLM releases more space than Air France if you're flexible on routing through Amsterdam.

If you fly both short and long-haul Europe, honestly just accumulate both. They transfer from the same cards anyway (Amex, Chase, Citi)."
```

**Comment Template #3: Sweet Spot Advice**
```
Subreddit: r/awardtravel
Topic: "Best use of 100k Avios?"

Response:
"Qatar QSuites hands down—if you can find availability. London to Doha to Singapore is 70,000 Avios in business, and QSuites is genuinely better than most first class products. The catch is availability is tight on popular routes, so book 354 days out or get lucky with last-minute space.

Alternative: If Asia isn't your thing, look at Iberia business to South America. Madrid to Buenos Aires is 68,000 Avios and often has better availability than transatlantic routes. Or JAL to Tokyo—60,000 in business, 100,000 in first if you can find it.

Worst use? British Airways long-haul because of fuel surcharges. You'll pay £300-600 on top of miles. Stick to partner airlines where possible."
```

**Thursday-Sunday (2-3 comments/day):**
Continue answering questions naturally

## 📝 Content Posts (Phase 2 - Week 2+)

### Post #1: QSuites Availability Alert
**Subreddit:** r/awardtravel  
**Type:** Time-sensitive information  
**UTM:** `?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=qsuites_alert`

**Title:**
"Qatar QSuites award space just opened up for summer 2026 (LHR-DOH routes)"

**Body:**
```
Heads up—I was searching this morning and saw a bunch of QSuites space open up for June-August 2026 on London Heathrow to Doha routes. Usually these get snapped up fast, but there's availability right now for multiple dates.

Routes with space I spotted:
- LHR-DOH: June 15, 22, 29 / July 6, 13, 20 / August 3, 10
- Connecting to SIN, HKG, SYD showing space too

Pricing: 42,500 Avios one-way LHR-DOH (business), 70,000 LHR-SIN via DOH

If you've been waiting for QSuites space, worth checking qatar.com or ba.com now. From experience these windows don't last long—I've seen full availability disappear in 24-48 hours.

For anyone new to QSuites: it's private suites with closing doors, lie-flat beds, 100GB WiFi, and dine-on-demand service. Genuinely the best business class product I've flown. [Here's a detailed guide on booking it with Avios](https://www.milestopup.com/blog/qatar-qsuites-complete-guide-booking-with-avios?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=qsuites_alert) if you're interested.

Happy booking!
```

**Why this works:**
- Provides genuine value (availability alert)
- Time-sensitive (creates urgency)
- Personal experience (not corporate)
- Link is optional/supplementary, not the main point

### Post #2: Comparison Guide
**Subreddit:** r/churning  
**Type:** Educational  
**UTM:** `?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=avios_fb_comparison`

**Title:**
"Avios vs Flying Blue: I spent 6 months tracking both programs—here's what I learned"

**Body:**
```
I've been obsessively tracking award availability and pricing for both British Airways Avios and Air France-KLM Flying Blue for the last 6 months (yes, I have a problem). Figured I'd share what I learned since this question comes up constantly.

**TL;DR:**
- Avios = Better for short-haul, predictable pricing, partner awards (Qatar, JAL)
- Flying Blue = Better for long-haul, monthly promos, less fuel surcharges

**The detailed breakdown:**

**Avios Wins:**
1. Short-haul Europe: London-Barcelona = 13,000 vs Flying Blue's 25,000+
2. Partner availability: Qatar QSuites, JAL First, Iberia—all bookable with Avios
3. Predictable pricing: Distance-based chart means you know what routes cost
4. UK-based value: If you're in London, Avios is king for weekend trips

**Flying Blue Wins:**
1. Monthly Promo Rewards: 25-50% off on 50+ routes every month
2. Lower surcharges: £50-150 vs BA's £300-600 on long-haul
3. KLM availability: Way more space than Air France on most routes
4. Better value on ultra-long-haul: Pricing is dynamic but often cheaper than Avios for 10+ hour flights

**My strategy:** I accumulate both. Transfer Amex points to whichever makes sense for the specific booking. 

[Here's a deeper comparison](https://www.milestopup.com/blog/avios-vs-flying-blue-which-miles-should-you-get?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=avios_fb_comparison) if you want the full analysis with actual redemption examples.

Happy to answer questions if anyone's trying to decide between the two!
```

**Why this works:**
- Original research (6 months tracking)
- Actionable advice
- Admits bias ("yes, I have a problem")
- Link is supplementary, not required

### Post #3: Buying Miles Discussion
**Subreddit:** r/awardtravel  
**Type:** Strategy discussion  
**UTM:** `?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=buying_miles`

**Title:**
"Unpopular opinion: Buying miles for premium cabins is often smarter than paying cash"

**Body:**
```
I know buying miles gets hate in this community, but hear me out. I ran the numbers on 20 different premium cabin routes, and in 15 of them, buying miles beat cash fares by a significant margin.

**Example that opened my eyes:**
Qatar QSuites London → Sydney:
- Cash business fare: £4,500
- Award cost: 84,000 Avios + £120 taxes
- If you buy those Avios at even 1.3p per mile: £1,092 + £120 = £1,212 total
- Savings: £3,288 (73% off)

**When buying makes sense:**
✅ Premium cabins on expensive routes (business/first long-haul)
✅ Partner airlines with low surcharges (Qatar, JAL, Cathay)
✅ When you're slightly short of an award and there's availability
✅ During airline bonus promotions (50-100% bonus miles)

**When it doesn't:**
❌ Short-haul economy (redemption value too low)
❌ BA long-haul (surcharges destroy the value)
❌ When you're speculating without confirmed availability

**The math:** If you're getting 3-5p per Avios in redemption value and buying at 1-1.3p, you're still coming out way ahead versus cash fares.

I've done this 4 times now for various QSuites and JAL First bookings. Every time I've saved £2,000-4,000 compared to what I would've paid in cash.

Curious if others have similar experiences or if I'm just justifying bad decisions?

[Detailed breakdown of costs by method here](https://www.milestopup.com/blog/best-price-to-purchase-avios-points-2026?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=buying_miles) if you're into spreadsheets.
```

**Why this works:**
- Contrarian take (generates discussion)
- Shows math/logic (credible)
- Admits uncertainty ("or am I justifying bad decisions?")
- Invites debate (engagement)

### Post #4: Flying Blue Promo Alert
**Subreddit:** r/awardtravel  
**Type:** Deal alert  
**UTM:** `?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo&utm_content=fb_promo_march`

**Title:**
"Flying Blue March Promo Rewards are live—some excellent deals this month"

**Body:**
```
March Promo Rewards just dropped and there are some genuinely good ones this month:

**Highlights I spotted:**
- Paris → Tokyo: 52,500 miles (normally 70,000) - 25% off
- Amsterdam → Bangkok: 41,250 miles (normally 55,000) - 25% off
- Paris → NYC: 47,500 miles (normally 63,000) - 25% off

**How Promo Rewards work:**
Flying Blue discounts 50-100 routes every month by 25-50%. You can book these promos throughout the month for travel up to 11 months out.

**Pro tip:** If you've been accumulating Amex/Chase points, transfer when you find space. Transfers are instant, so you don't need to speculatively transfer and hope for availability.

Full list: flyingblue.com (search under "Book a Flight with Miles" → filter by Promo Rewards)

Anyone booking any of these? Would love to hear which routes people find space on—availability varies wildly even within promo routes.

[Guide to Flying Blue Promos](https://www.milestopup.com/blog/flying-blue-promo-rewards-guide?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo&utm_content=fb_promo_march)
```

**Why this works:**
- Timely/actionable (monthly recurring)
- Specific examples with pricing
- Educational for newcomers
- Creates discussion ("Anyone booking these?")
